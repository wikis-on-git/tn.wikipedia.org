== Lobolo and the Law ==
In [[Aferika Borwa|South Africa]], where the custom of lobolo is widely practiced, the union was previously concluded in terms of customary law, but is now governed under the Recognition of Customary Marriages,1998 (Act 120 of 1998) <ref name="Herbst and Du Plessis">{{cite journal|last1 = Herbst|first1 = Marissa|last2 = Du Plessis|first2 = Willemien|title = Customary Law v Common Law Marriages: A Hybrid Approach in South Africa|journal = Electronic J of Comparative Law|date = 2008|volume = 410|issue = 1989|pages = 1–15}}</ref>(RCMA) and has the following prerequisites to qualify a marriage under customary law:

== Negotiations ==
The process of Lobolo negotiations can be long and complex, and involves many members from both the bride's and the groom's extended families; normally, this would just be the uncles of the marrying parties, as well as the fathers, where custom allows. Sometimes women are also allowed to be present, but in the side-lines of the negotiations, not actively taking part in the negotiations. Often, to dispel any tensions between the families, a bottle of brandy is placed on the table, however, this is not limited to brandy, and it can be traditional sorghum beer. This is usually not drunk; it is simply a gesture to welcome the guest family and make everyone feel more relaxed, and it is known as ''mvulamlomo'', which is Xhosa for 'mouth opener' (Sotho - "Pulamolomo")i.e. price for opening your mouth (to speak) to express the purpose of your visit. It is up to the potential wife’s delegation to decide as to whether to make use of the alcohol or keep it closed.

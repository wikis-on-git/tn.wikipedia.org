{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon''' is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] that adherents believe contains writings of ancient [[prophets]] who lived on the [[Americas|American continent]] from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.<ref>[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 "Praise to the Man"], 1979-11-04.</ref><ref>[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.</ref> It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the [[Plates of Nephi]]''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}. In 1982, in an effort to clarify and emphasize its purpose, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) retitled its editions of the book to ''The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'' {{harvtxt|LDS Church|2008}}.</ref>

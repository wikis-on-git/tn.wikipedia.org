=== Ecological systems ===
Gape e bidiwa "deveelopment in context" kgotsa "human ecology" theory, ecological systems theory, ka tlhago e tlhamilwe ke Urie Bronfenbrenner e nankola mehuta e mene ya nested environmental systems, tse di nang le khuetso e bi-directional  ka gare le magareng  within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''<ref>{{cite book|author=Bronfenbrenner, Urie|title=The ecology of human development: experiments by nature and design|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1979|isbn=978-0-674-22456-8|oclc=4515541}}</ref> has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this influential conceptualization of development, these environments — from the family to economic and political structures — have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through adulthood.<ref name="Smith, Cowie, Blades, 2011">{{cite book|author1=Blades, Mark|author2=Smith, Peter K.|author3=Cowie, Helen|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-7601-9|oclc=620124946}}</ref>

=== Piaget ===
Jean Piaget was a Swiss scholar who began his studies in intellectual development in the 1920s. Piaget’s first interests were those that dealt with the ways in which animals adapt to their environments and his first scientific article about this subject was published when he was 10 years old. This eventually led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Zoology, which then led him to his second interest in epistemology.<ref name="SHAFFER">{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|edition=6th}}</ref> Epistemology branches off from philosophy and deals with the origin of knowledge. Piaget believed the origin of knowledge came from Psychology, so he traveled to Paris and began working on the first “standardized intelligence test” at Alfred Binet laboratories; this influenced his career greatly. As he carried out this intelligence testing he began developing a profound interest in the way children’s intellectualism works. As a result, he developed his own laboratory and spent years recording children’s intellectual growth and attempted to find out how children develop through various stages of thinking. This led to Piaget develop four important stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2), preoperational stage (age 2 to 7), concrete-operational stage (ages 7 to 12), and formal-operational stage (ages 11 to 12, and thereafter).<ref name="SHAFFER" />

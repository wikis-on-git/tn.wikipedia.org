The capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of tools including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and an extensive vocabulary. Language can be vocalized as in speech, or manual as in sign. The human language capacity is represented in the brain. Even though the human language capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of sentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called recursion. Evidence suggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow sentences to go indeterminately. These three mechanisms are: ''relativization'', ''complementation'' and ''coordination''.<ref name="Lightfoot, 2010">{{cite journal|last1=Lightfoot|first1=David|title=Language acquisition and language change|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=1|issue=5|year=2010|pages=677–684|issn=1939-5078|doi=10.1002/wcs.39}}</ref> Furthermore, there are actually two main guiding principles in first-language acquisition, that is, speech perception always precedes speech production and the gradually evolving system by which a child learns a language is built up one step at a time, beginning with the distinction between individual phonemes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=107–108|isbn=0-521-29239-5}}</ref>

Philosophers in ancient societies were interested in how humans acquired the ability to understand and produce language well before empirical methods for testing those theories were developed, but for the most part they seemed to regard language acquisition as a subset of man's ability to acquire knowledge and learn concepts.<ref name="Innateness and Language">{{Cite web|title=Innateness and Language|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/#ChoCasAgaSki|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Some early observation-based ideas about language acquisition were proposed by Plato, who felt that word-meaning mapping in some form was innate. Additionally, Sanskrit grammarians debated for over twelve centuries whether humans' ability to recognize the meaning of words was god-given (possibly innate) or passed down by previous generations and learned from already established conventions: a child learning the word for cow by listening to trusted speakers talking about cows.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Noam|first1=Chomsky|last2=Skinner|first2=B.

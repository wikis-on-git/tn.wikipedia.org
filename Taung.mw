'''Taung''' ke toropo e nnyane kwa profenseng ya [[Bokone Bophirima]]. Lefelo le le theeletswe ka Kgosi Tau wa Barolong. Tau was a warrior who ruled with an iron feist. According to the oral tradition, king Tau was a ruthless military leader, much like 
Shaka of the Zulu kingdom, who conquered and subjugated the neighbouring groups like the Kora, Bakgalagadi and the Bahurutshe. He treated his own people like slaves, killed the Kora, the San and also members of his own 
community. Those Barolong that he alienated, because of lack of food, were forced to eat fish from Vaal River, and they were therefore called the Batlhaping 
(Parson, 1984:47). Tau's attempts to control the Batlhaping brought him into conflict with the Kora who had joined the Batlhaping in an alliance after Tau had 
killed a Kora chief. The Kora chief's brother, Matsaledi,then ambushed Tau and killed him in about 1760 in Taung (War Office, 1905:8).

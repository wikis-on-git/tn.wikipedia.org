== Article count ==

Could someone who knows this language please add the article count to the Main Page using the <nowiki>{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}</nowiki> template? (It currently shows {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} articles.) Please display it in an "obvious" way (say, '''bold''' and linked to [[Special:Statistics]]) so someone like me, who doesn't know the language, can still tell it's the article count. Thanks. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 09:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== some intro ==

Welcome to [[Wikipedia]], a community project with the goal to create in every language from a neutral point of view a free encyclopedia on the internet. Wikipedia is free of charge, and can be used to find information even without logging in, but also to add information or to edit. Because of this, Wikipedia can give [[Wikipedia:Disclaimer|no guarantee]] for the correctness of the available information. You can experiment in the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]. This Tswana Wikipedia counts [[Special:statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles.

:I translated this from dutch, and I think this might be, if translated in Tswana, a good intro for on the main page. Further I think there are some things that should be translated from English, such as [[:en:Wikipedia]] (or a part of it) and [[:en:GFDL]] (the license, but again a part of it is good enough). Some disclaimerpages should be filled with "we guarentee nothing etc" I think. This is a pretty boring job, I know...  
:For later you could translate some day "The free encyclopedia" to Tswana, so that the logo can be adapted. But that might be a thing to do if there is some more community. 
:I guess some systemmessages have to be translated as well. I think the most important is "All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (see Copyrights for details).
Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc." what should be at the bottom of every page, in [[Mediawiki:Copyright]]. You can find more systemmessages in [[Special:Allmessages]], but please be carefull with editing them. As long as you change aq story-text, no problem, but take care of odd symbols etc and dollar-signs like $1. They might be a variable. [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 16:58, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

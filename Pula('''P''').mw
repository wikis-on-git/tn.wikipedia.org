The '''pula''' is the [[currency]] of [[Botswana]]. It has the [[ISO 4217]] code ''BWP'' and is subdivided into 100 ''thebe''. ''Pula'' literally means "rain" in [[Setswana]], because [[rain]] is very scarce in Botswana — home to much of the [[Kalahari Desert]] — and therefore valuable and a blessing. The word also serves as the national motto of the country.

A sub-unit of the currency is known as ''thebe'', or "shield",<ref>{{cite book|last=Masire|first=Ketumile|authorlink=Ketumile Masire|title=Very brave or very foolish?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb8VAQAAIAAJ |year=2006|publisher=Macmillan Botswana |isbn=978-99912-404-8-0 |page=81 |quote= ''Pula'' (rain) was an easy choice for the currency, and the decimal coins were called ''thebe'' (shield).}} (Memoirs of a former president of Botswana)</ref> and represents defence.<ref name=Chartered/> The names were picked with the help of the public.<ref name=Chartered>{{cite book|title=Standard Chartered Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMq3AAAAIAAJ |year=1976|publisher=Standard Chartered Bank|page=9|quote= The new names ''pula'' and ''thebe'' were chosen following an invitation to the public to submit their suggestions [...] The meaning of "thebe" is shield — the traditional means of defence.}}</ref>

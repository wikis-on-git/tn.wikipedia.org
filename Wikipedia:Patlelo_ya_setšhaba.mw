==Bot policy==
Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. This will involve creating a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and adding a line at the top noting that it is used here. In particular, this policy allows automatic acceptance of known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests.

Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; it will be implemented in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. —<small>[[m:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 03:10:35, 30 Ngwanatsele 2007 (UTC)</small>

==Global bots==
Hello. The [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] was updated to allow global bots, which are now technically possible. These are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots (the local policy or request page must explicitly allow them, or they won't get access on this wiki). The [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|current requirements]] for global bots are:
* a global bot must only maintain interlanguage links or fix double-redirects;
* a global bot must have already been active on several wikis, with long-term contributions demonstrating its trustworthiness.

Does anyone object to allowing global bots on this wiki? I'll update the local policy in a week if there are no objections. Thanks. —<small>[[m:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 18:05:55, 28 Phukwi 2008 (UTC)</small>

==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 4.63% of the MediaWiki messages and 0.04% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised. Please help us help your language by localising and proof reading at [[betawiki:Special:LanguageStats/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}|translatewiki.net]]. This is the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&translations=only&trailer=/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}} recent localisation activity] for your language.

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

==Fundraising time is around the corner!==
Hello Wikimedians, my name is Deniz and I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation during the 2010 Fundraiser. My job is to be the liaison between the Setswana community and the Foundation. This year's fundraiser is intended to be a collaborative and global effort, we recognize that banner messages that perform well in the United States don't necessarily translate well, or appeal to international audiences. <Br>

I'm contacting you as I am currently looking for translators who are willing to contribute to this project, helping to translate and localize messages into Setswana and suggesting messages that would appeal to Setswana readers on the Fundraising Meta Page. We've started the setup on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 meta] for both [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages banner submission], [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Banner_testing statistical analysis], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Committee grouping volunteers together].<br>Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us, and add your feedback to the proposed messages as well! I look forward to working with you during this year's fundraiser.<br>

Please translate this message into Setswana if you can and post it below.--[[User:Dgultekin|Dgultekin]] 17:00, 10 Lwetse 2010 (UTC)

====Fundraising 2010: Beat Jimmy Challenge====

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a challenge: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 we want you to beat Jimmy]. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy banner up for two months.  We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010#Focus_Group donor focus group], and the results of our [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FR_Donor_survey_report.pdf donor survey]. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer rely on instinct alone. 

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings.  Add the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages/BeatJimmy here] to be tested '''Tuesday October 12''' against Jimmy. -[[User:Dgultekin|Dgultekin]] 00:02, 7 Phalane 2010 (UTC)

== Call for image filter referendum ==

The Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.

Further details and educational materials will be available shortly.  The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.  Referendum details, officials, voting requirements, and supporting materials will be posted at [[Meta:Image filter referendum]] shortly.

Sorry for delivering you a message in English. Please help translate the pages on the referendum on Meta and join the [[mail:translators-l|translators mailing list]].

For more information, please read the [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/RELEASE-NOTES-1.19?view=markup release notes] or the [[mw:MediaWiki_1.19|start of the final announcement]].

The following are the areas that you will probably be most interested in:
* [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33711#c2 Faster loading of javascript files makes dependency tracking more important.]
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki cache is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
* More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists).
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.

Report any [http://labs.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Problem_reports problems] on the labs beta wiki and we'll work to address them before they software is released to the production wikis.

'''Note''' that this cluster does have SUL but it is not integrated with SUL in production, so you'll need to create another account.  You should avoid using the same password as you use here.  — [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 16:37, 15 Firikgong 2012 (UTC)

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to upgrade MediaWiki (the software powering this wiki) to its latest version this month. You can help to test it before it is enabled, to avoid disruption and breakage. More information is available [[:mw:MediaWiki 1.19/Deployment announcement|in the full announcement]]. Thank you for your understanding.

==Language support group for Tswana==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net. <br>
Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 07:58, 15 Tlhakole 2012 (UTC)

===Babel extension===
The babel extension is used on all the WMF wikis by people who want to indicate their proficiency in a language. Sadly this has not yet been done for the Tswana language. Would you be so kind and help us by [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-babel&language=tn localising the babel extension] in the Tswana language? Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 07:58, 15 Tlhakole 2012 (UTC)

== Update on IPv6 ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it, as well as '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement on Meta]]''') 

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to do limited testing of IPv6 on June 2-3. If there are not too many problems, we may fully enable IPv6 on [http://www.worldipv6day.org/ World IPv6 day] (June 6), and keep it enabled.

What this means for your project:

*At least on June 2-3, 2012, you may see a small number of edits from IPv6 addresses, which are in the form "<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>". See e.g. [[w:en:IPv6 address]]. These addresses should behave like any other IP address: You can leave messages on their talk pages; you can track their contributions; you can block them. (See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] for notes on range blocks.)

*In the mid term, some user scripts and tools will need to be adapted for IPv6. 

*We suspect that IPv6 usage is going to be very low initially, meaning that abuse should be manageable, and we will assist in the monitoring of the situation.

Read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] on how to test the behavior of IPv6 with various tools and how to leave bug reports, and to find a fuller analysis of the implications of the IPv6 migration.

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the ''2011 Picture of the Year competition'' is now open. We are interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the ''Picture of the Year 2011''. Any user registered at Commons or a Wikimedia wiki SUL-related to Commons [//toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/?user=&wiki=&event=24 with more than 75 edits before 1 April 2012 (UTC)] is welcome to vote and, of course everyone is welcome to view!

Detailed information about the contest can be found [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Introduction|at the introductory page]].

About 600 of the best of Wikimedia Common's photos, animations, movies and graphics were chosen &ndash;by the international Wikimedia Commons community&ndash; out of 12 million files during ''2011'' and are now called ''Featured Pictures''.

From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons ''Features Pictures'' of all flavors.  

For your convenience, we have sorted the images [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Galleries|into topic categories]]. 

We regret that you receive this message in English; we intended to use banners to notify you in your native language but there was both, human and technical resistance.

See you on Commons!

== Help decide about more than $10 million of Wikimedia donations in the coming year ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
''(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it)''

Hi,

As many of you are aware, the Wikimedia Board of Trustees recently initiated important changes in the way that money is being distributed within the Wikimedia movement. As part of this, a new community-led "[[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC|Funds Dissemination Committee]]" (FDC) is currently being set up. Already in 2012-13, its recommendations will guide the decisions about the distribution of over 10 million US dollars among the Foundation, chapters and other [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#Eligible_fund-seeking_entities|eligible entities]].

Now, seven capable, knowledgeable and trustworthy community members are sought to volunteer on the initial Funds Dissemination Committee. It is expected to take up its work in September. In addition, a community member is sought to be the [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#FDC_Ombudsperson|Ombudsperson]] for the FDC process. If you are interested in joining the committee, read the [[m:Funds Dissemination Committee/Call for Volunteers|call for volunteers]]. Nominations are planned to close on August 15.

== Wikidata is getting close to a first roll-out ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) 

As some of you might already have heard Wikimedia Deutschland is working on a new Wikimedia project. It is called [[m:Wikidata]]. The goal of Wikidata is to become a central data repository for the Wikipedias, its sister projects and the world. In the future it will hold data like the number of inhabitants of a country, the date of birth of a famous person or the length of a river. These can then be used in all Wikimedia projects and outside of them.

The project is divided into three phases and "we are getting close to roll-out the first phase". The phases are:
# language links in the Wikipedias (making it possible to store the links between the language editions of an article just once in Wikidata instead of in each linked article)
# infoboxes (making it possible to store the data that is currently in infoboxes in one central place and share the data)
# lists (making it possible to create lists and similar things based on queries to Wikidata so they update automatically when new data is added or modified)

It'd be great if you could join us, test the [http://wikidata-test.wikimedia.de demo version], provide feedback and take part in the development of Wikidata. You can find all the relevant information including an [[m:Wikidata/FAQ|FAQ]] and sign-up links for our on-wiki newsletter on [[m:Wikidata|the Wikidata page on Meta]]. 

For further discussions please use [[m:Talk:Wikidata|this talk page]] (if you are uncomfortable writing in English you can also write in your native language there) or point [[m:User_talk:Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)|me]] to the place where your discussion is happening so I can answer there.

== Fundraising localization: volunteers from outside the USA needed ==

''Please translate for your local community''

Hello All,

The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. ''All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed'' (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!

Thanks!<br />

== Wikimedia sites to move to primary data center in Ashburn, Virginia. Read-only mode expected. ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) Next week, the Wikimedia Foundation will transition its main technical operations to a new data center in Ashburn, Virginia, USA. This is intended to improve the technical performance and reliability of all Wikimedia sites, including this wiki. There will be some times when the site will be in read-only mode, and there may be full outages; the current target windows for the migration are January 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 2013, from 17:00 to 01:00 UTC (see [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Wikimedia+data+center+migration&iso=20130122T17&ah=8 other timezones] on timeanddate.com). More information is available [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/01/19/wikimedia-sites-move-to-primary-data-center-in-ashburn-virginia/ in the full announcement].

If you would like to stay informed of future technical upgrades, consider [[m:Tech/Ambassadors|becoming a Tech ambassador]] and [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors joining the ambassadors mailing list].

== Wikidata phase 1 (language links) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally.

[[d:|Wikidata]] has been in development for a few months now. It is now time for the roll-out of the first part of it on your Wikipedia. Phase 1 is the support for the management of language links. It is already being used on the Hungarian, Hebrew, Italian and English Wikipedias. The next step is to enable the extension on all other Wikipedias. We have currently planned this for March 6.

=== What is Wikidata? ===
Wikidata is a central place to store data that you can usually find in infoboxes. Think of it as something like Wikimedia Commons but for data (like the number of inhabitants of a country or the length of a river) instead of multimedia. The first part of this project (centralizing language links) is being rolled out now. The more fancy things will follow later.

=== What is going to happen? ===
Language links in the sidebar are going to come from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

=== Where can I find more information and ask questions? ===
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

=== I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata ===

We have already done this on the [[http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/03/27/you-can-have-all-the-data/ first 11 Wikipedias]] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) and things are looking good. The next step is English Wikipedia. This is planned for April 8. '''If everything works out fine we will deploy on all remaining Wikipedias on April 10.''' I will update [[m:Wikidata/Deployment Questions#When_will_this_be_deployed_on_my_Wikipedia.3F|this part of the FAQ]] if there are any issues forcing us to change this date. I will also sent another note to this village pump once the deployment is finished.

'''What will happen once we have phase 2 enabled here?'''
Once it is enabled in a few days you will be able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!)

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Yahoo!. This will return “[[d:Q14086|Marissa Mayer]]” as she is the [[d:Property:P169|chief executive officer]] of the [[d:Q37093|company]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:chief executive officer}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can already test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2].

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

Hello!

There is [[m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|a new request for comment]] on Meta-Wiki concerning the removal of administrative rights from long-term inactive Wikimedians. Generally, this proposal from stewards would apply to wikis without an administrators' review process.

We are also compiling a [[m:Talk:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|list of projects]] with procedures for removing inactive administrators on the talk page of the request for comment. Feel free to add your project(s) to the list if you have a policy on administrator inactivity.

All input is appreciated. The discussion may close as soon as 21 May 2013 (2013-05-21), but this will be extended if needed.

Thanks, [[m:User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]] <small>(thanks to all the [[m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders/Global message|translators]]!)</small> 05:24, 24 Moranang 2013 (UTC)

== Wikidata phase 2 (infoboxes) is here ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

A while ago the first phase of [[d:|Wikidata]] was enabled on this Wikipedia. This means you are getting the language links in each article from Wikidata. We have now enabled the second phase of Wikidata (infoboxes) here. We have already done this on the [[http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/03/27/you-can-have-all-the-data/ first 11 Wikipedias]] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) a month ago and [http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/04/22/and-that-makes-12/ two days ago on the English Wikipedia]. Today all the remaining Wikipedias followed.

'''What does having phase 2 enabled here mean?'''
You are now able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!) The current state is just the beginning though. It will be extended based on feedback we get from you now.

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Wikimedia Foundation. This will return “[[d:Q62|San Francisco]]” as that is the [[d:Property:P159|headquarter location]] of the [[d:180|non-profit]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:headquarter location}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2] if you don't want to do it in an article here.

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

'''I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata'''
To stay up-to-date on everything happening around Wikidata please [[meta:Global message delivery/Targets/Wikidata|subscribe]] to the newsletter that is delivered weekly to subscribed user’s talk pages.


We are excited about taking yet another step towards allowing all Wikipedias share structured data and collect and curate it together.

== [en] Change to section edit links ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr">
The default position of the "edit" link in page section headers is going to change soon. The "edit" link will be positioned adjacent to the page header text rather than floating opposite it.

Section edit links will be to the immediate right of section titles, instead of on the far right. If you're an editor of one of the wikis which already implemented this change, nothing will substantially change for you; however, scripts and gadgets depending on the previous implementation of section edit links will have to be adjusted to continue working; however, nothing else should break even if they are not updated in time.

[[m:Change to section edit links|Detailed information and a timeline]] is available on meta.

Ideas to do this all the way to 2009 at least. It is often difficult to track which of several potential section edit links on the far right is associated with the correct section, and many readers and anonymous or new editors may even be failing to notice section edit links at all, since they read section titles, which are far away from the links.

== VisualEditor and your Wikipedia ==

''(Please translate this message)''

Greetings,

The Wikimedia Foundation will soon turn on [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] for all users, all the time on your Wikipedia. Right now your Wikipedia does not have any local documents on VisualEditor, and we hope that your community can change that. To find out about how you can help with translations visit the [[mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|TranslationCentral for VisualEditor]] and read the easy instructions on [[mw:VisualEditor/Portal/Localization|bringing information to your Wikipedia]]. The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|User Guide]] and the [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ|FAQ]] are very important to have in your language.
 
We want to find out as much as we can from you about VisualEditor and how it helps your Wikipedia, and having local pages is a great way to start. We also encourage you to [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|leave feedback on Mediawiki]] where the community can offer ideas, opinions, and point out bugs that may still exist in the software that need to be reported to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=VisualEditor Bugzilla]. 
If you are able to speak for the concerns of others in English on MediaWiki or locally I encourage you to help your community to be represented in this process.

If you can help translate the user interface for VisualEditor to your language, you can help with that as well. [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc Translatewiki] has open tasks for translating VisualEditor. A direct link to translate the user interface is [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Special:Translate?filter=!translated&action=translate&group=ext-visualeditor here].  You can see how we are doing with those translations [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc here]. You need an account on Translatewiki to translate.  This account is free and easy to create.

If we can help your community in any way with this process, please let me know and I will do my best to assist your Wikipedia with this |exciting development. You can contact me on my [[m:User_talk:Keegan (WMF)|meta talk page]] or by [[Special:EmailUser/Keegan (WMF)|email]].  You can also contact [[mw:User_talk:PEarley_(WMF)|Patrick Earley]] for help with translations and documents on Mediawiki.  We look forward to working with you to bring the VisualEditor experience to your Wikipedia! [[:m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[:m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 19:15, 30 Phukwi 2013 (UTC)

Greetings!  

[[mw:Echo|Notifications]] will inform users about new activity that affects them on this wiki in a unified way: for example, this new tool will let you know when you have new talk page messages, edit reverts, mentions or links -- and is designed to augment (rather than replace) the watchlist. The Wikimedia Foundation's editor engagement team developed this tool (code-named 'Echo') earlier this year, to help users contribute more productively to MediaWiki projects. 

We're now getting ready to bring Notifications to almost all other Wikimedia sites, and are aiming for a 22 October deployment, as outlined in [[mw:Echo/Release_Plan_2013|this release plan]]. It is important that notifications is translated for all of the languages we serve.  

There are three major points of translation needed to be either done or checked:
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-echo#sortable:3=desc Echo on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-thanks#sortable:3=desc Thanks on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[[mw:Help:Notifications|Notifications help on mediawiki.org]].  This page can be hosted after translation on mediawiki.org or we can localize it to this Wikipedia.  You do not have to have an account to translate on mediawiki, but single-user login will create it for you there if you follow the link.
:*[[mw:Echo/Release Plan 2013#Checklist|Checklist]]

Please let us know if you have any questions, suggestions or comments about this new tool.

== Speak up about the trademark registration of the Community logo. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all, 

Please join the consultation about the Community logo that represents Meta-Wiki: [[:m:Community Logo/Request for consultation]].

This community consultation was commenced on September 24. The following day, two individuals filed a legal opposition against the registration of the Community logo.

The question is whether the Wikimedia Foundation should seek a collective membership mark with respect to this logo or abandon its registration and protection of the trademark. 

We want to make sure that everyone get a chance to speak up so that we can get clear direction from the community.  We would therefore really appreciate the community's help in translating this announcement from English so that everyone is able to understand it.

Thanks,

== Introducting Beta Features ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''(Apologies for writing in English. Please translate if necessary)''

We would like to let you know about [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features]], a new program from the Wikimedia Foundation that lets you try out new features before they are released for everyone.

Think of it as a digital laboratory where community members can preview upcoming software and give feedback to help improve them. This special preference page lets designers and engineers experiment with new features on a broad scale, but in a way that's not disruptive.

Beta Features is now ready for testing on [[mw:Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|MediaWiki.org]]. It will also be released on Wikimedia Commons and MetaWiki this Thursday, 7 November. Based on test results, the plan is to release it on all wikis worldwide on 21 November, 2013.

Here are the first features you can test this week:
* [[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] — view images in large size or full screen
* [[mw:VisualEditor/Beta_Features/Formulae|VisualEditor Formulæ]] (for wikis with [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]) — edit algebra or equations on your pages
* [[mw:Typography_Update|Typography Refresh]] —  make text more readable (coming Thursday)

Would you like to try out Beta Features now? After you log in on MediaWiki.org, a small 'Beta' link will appear next to your 'Preferences'. Click on it to see features you can test, check the ones you want, then click 'Save'. Learn more on the [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features page]].

After you've tested Beta Features, please let the developers know what you think on [[mw:Talk:About_Beta_Features|this discussion page]] -- or report any bugs [http://wmbug.com/new?product=MediaWiki%20extensions&component=BetaFeatures here on Bugzilla]. You're also welcome to join [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|this IRC office hours chat]] on Friday, 8 November at 18:30 UTC. 

Beta Features was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation's Design, Multimedia and VisualEditor teams. Along with other developers, they will be adding new features to this experimental program every few weeks. They are very grateful to all the community members who helped create this project — and look forward to many more productive collaborations in the future.

Enjoy, and don't forget to let developers know what you think!  [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 20:44, 5 Ngwanatsele 2013 (UTC)

== Call for comments on draft trademark policy ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hi all, 

The Wikimedia legal team invites you to participate in the development of the new Wikimedia trademark policy.

The [[:wmf:Trademark policy|current trademark policy]] was introduced in 2009 to protect the [[:wmf:Wikimedia trademarks|Wikimedia marks]]. We are now updating this policy to better balance permissive use of the marks with the legal requirements for preserving them for the community. The new draft trademark policy is ready for your review [[:m:Trademark policy|here]], and we encourage you to discuss it [[:m:Talk:Trademark policy|here]].

We would appreciate if someone would translate this message into your language so more members of your community can contribute to the conversation.

==VisualEditor coming to Tswana Wikipedia==

Dumela. :) Hi. :) 

Please pardon my English. I hope someone will translate my message into Setswana or any other language that people speak here. 

Leina la me ko Anna. :) My name is Anna. :) I am a Community Advocate at the Wikimedia Foundation in [[:w:San_Francisco|San Francisco]]. It's nice to meet you. :) 

[[:en:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] is coming to the Tswana Wikipedia, probably sometime in January. VisualEditor is software in development to allow people to edit pages in MediaWiki without needing to learn wikitext syntax (like typing <nowiki>[[</nowiki> and <nowiki>]]</nowiki> to link to another page). It is already available and in use on some Wikipedia projects. Please see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ]] for more information.

When this software arrives, you will have the option to use it or to use the current wikitext editor. When you press "Edit", you will get the new VisualEditor software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press "Edit source". For more information about how to use VisualEditor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]].

It is important that editors on this wiki test the new editor before it is deployed. This would let us know about any serious issues specific to this Wikipedia before the rollout. '''To enable VisualEditor now, go to your "Preferences", select "Beta Features", and check the box to enable "VisualEditor".''' 

Please let us know if you find any problems. If you are willing and if you are able, please [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/How to report a bug|report any problems in Bugzilla]] in the [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=VisualEditor&format=guided "VisualEditor" product]. Or you can explain any problems on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. 

If you notice major issues impacting your project, please let us know directly. You can email me or leave a note on my talk page or, if there is an emergency, like an unexpected bug is causing widespread problems, contact James Forrester, the Product Manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org for immediate attention.

We would also appreciate help translating the user interface and other pages about VisualEditor here on tn.wikipeida.org and on MediaWiki.org. See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|VisualEditor TranslationCentral]] for general information. 

To help with translations, you will need to create an account on [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AFirstSteps&type=on TranslateWiki]. An administrator will approve your account request. 

Here is what needs to be translated into Setswana:

* [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=wiki-betawiki&language=tn&filter=%21translated&action=translate Translatewiki:User interface]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Help%3AVisualEditor%2FUser+guide&filter=&language=tn&action=translate Help:VisualEditor/User guide]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Help%3AVisualEditor%2FFAQ&filter=&language=tn&action=translate Help:VisualEditor/FAQ]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-VisualEditor%2FPortal&filter=&language=tn&action=translate VisualEditor/Portal]

On each of these pages, you will see the text needs to be translated: words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs. The original English text will be on one side, with the option to "edit" on the other. Pressing "edit" will open an edit window where you can enter the translated text.

There are resources for translators at [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral#To_do]].

If you want to help with translations and would like to talk about how, please email me or leave me message on my talk page.

I have started a local page about VisualEditor [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|here]]. Please feel free to add to it.

Ke itumetse! Thank you! And happy editing! :) --18:00, 17 Sedimonthole 2013 (UTC)

==Translators Needed==

Hi! :) Dumela! :) 

Please pardon my English. I hope someone will translate my message into Setswana or another language that people speak here too. 

[[:en:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] is coming to the Tswana Wikipedia, sometime in January and we need help translating the user interface and other pages about VisualEditor here on tn.wikipeida.org and on MediaWiki.org. 

0% of the user interface, user guide,, FAQ, and portal page have been translated (see Tswana [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor-ve-mw here]). 

To help with translations, you must create an account on [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AFirstSteps&type=on TranslateWiki]. An administrator will approve your account request. 

Here is what still must be translated into Setswana:

* [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=wiki-betawiki&language=tn&filter=%21translated&action=translate Translatewiki:User interface]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Help%3AVisualEditor%2FUser+guide&filter=&language=tn&action=translate Help:VisualEditor/User guide]

* [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-VisualEditor%2FPortal&filter=&language=tn&action=translate VisualEditor/Portal]

On each of these pages, you will see the text needs to be translated: words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs. The original English text will be on one side, with the option to "edit" on the other. Pressing "edit" will open an edit window where you can enter the translated text.

See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|VisualEditor TranslationCentral]] for general information. See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral#To_do]] for resources for translators.

==VisualEditor Office Hours==

Dumela. :) Apologies for writing in English. Translation assistance is appreciated. :)

The WMF engineering department has planned [[:meta:Office Hours|office hours]] to discuss [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] -- software that will make it easier to edit Setswana Wikipedia. These discussions will be on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) at irc://irc.freenode.net/wikimedia-office. The first is on January 15th, at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=23&min=00&sec=0&day=15&month=01&year=2014 2300 UTC]; the second is a week later, on January 22nd, at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=23&min=00&sec=0&day=22&month=01&year=2014 2300 UTC]. Product Manager James Forrester will discuss VisualEditor and upcoming plans. Logs will be posted [[:meta:IRC_office_hours#Office_hour_logs|on Meta]] after each office hour completes. 

If you don't use Internet Relay Chat, you can go to http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikimedia-office to join in. Choose a nickname and type in the captcha code when prompted. You may also have to click through a security warning, but I'm told that it's safe. :)

If you want to ask a question or provide feedback but can't attend, or don't speak English, you can post your question or comment here or on my talk page or email me, and I will present it on your behalf. I’ll post another reminder closer to the office hours.

You can test the new interface before it is deployed. '''To enable VisualEditor now, go to your "Preferences", select "Beta Features", and check the box to enable "VisualEditor".'''  Please let us know what you like and what you don't like, what works well and what could be improved. 

Ke itumetse! [[User:AKoval_(WMF)|Anna Koval (WMF)]] ([[User talk:AKoval (WMF)|talk]]) 20:20, 31 Sedimonthole 2013 (UTC)

:Maybe you should link to webchat as well. Not everyone has an IRC client, but they may want to participate "live". Not that many people will read this page. Maybe Oarabile will. [[User:PiRSquared17|PiRSquared17]] ([[User talk:PiRSquared17|talk]]) 22:52, 1 Firikgong 2014 (UTC)

::That's actually a really helpful suggestion, [[User:PiRSquared17|Pi]], thank you! :) I didn't know that you could link to an IRC channel in a web browser like that. Thanks so much for showing me how. :) I've updated the post to include that information and I've reached out to [[User:Oarabile_Mudongo|Oarabile]]. Here's hoping! :) [[User:AKoval_(WMF)|Anna Koval (WMF)]] ([[User talk:AKoval (WMF)|talk]]) 23:20, 3 Firikgong 2014 (UTC)

*Thanks for reaching out to me about this amazing good news, i remember from our last wiki community meetup last month 2013 when we discussed about Visual Editor and having it enabled on our local page.

== Request for comment on Commons: Should Wikimedia support MP4 video? ==

''I apologize for this message being only in English. Please translate it if needed to help your community.''

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|multimedia team]] seeks community guidance on a proposal to support the [[w:MP4|MP4 video format]]. This digital video standard is used widely around the world to record, edit and watch videos on mobile phones, desktop computers and home video devices. It is also known as [[w:MP4|H.264/MPEG-4 or AVC]].

Supporting the MP4 format would make it much easier for our users to view and contribute video on Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects -- and video files could be offered in dual formats on our sites, so we could continue to support current open formats (WebM and Ogg Theora). 

However, MP4 is a patent-encumbered format, and using a proprietary format would be a departure from our current practice of only supporting open formats on our sites -- even though the licenses appear to have acceptable legal terms, with only a small fee required. 

We would appreciate your guidance on whether or not to support MP4. Our Request for Comments presents views both in favor and against MP4 support, based on opinions we’ve heard in our discussions with community and team members. 

[[commons:Commons:Requests for comment/MP4 Video|Please join this RfC -- and share your advice]].

All users are welcome to participate, whether you are active on Commons, Wikipedia, other Wikimedia project -- or any site that uses content from our free media repository.

You are also welcome to join tomorrow's [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|Office hours chat on IRC]],  this Thursday, January 16, at 19:00 UTC, if you would like to discuss this project with our team and other community members.

We look forward to a constructive discussion with you, so we can make a more informed decision together on this important topic. [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 06:47, 16 Firikgong 2014 (UTC)

== Universal Language Selector will be enabled by default again on this wiki by 21 February 2014 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
On January 21 2014 the MediaWiki extension [[mw:Universal Language Selector|Universal Language Selector]] (ULS) was [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Jan2014|disabled]] on this wiki. A new preference was added for logged-in users to turn on ULS. This was done to prevent slow loading of pages due to ULS webfonts, a behaviour that had been observed by the Wikimedia Technical Operations team on some wikis. 

We are now ready to enable ULS again. The temporary preference to enable ULS will be removed. A [[commons:File:ULS-font-checkbox.png|new checkbox]] has been added to the Language Panel to enable/disable font delivery. This will be unchecked by default for this wiki, but can be selected at any time by the users to enable webfonts. This is an interim solution while we improve the feature of webfonts delivery.

You can read the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Feb2014|announcement]] and the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Upcoming Development Plan|development plan]] for more information. Apologies for writing this message only in English. Thank you. [[m:User_talk:Runab WMF|Runa]]

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hello! It was noted that on this wiki you have [[Special:Statistics|less than 10 local files]].

However, this means that users here will experience a mostly broken and/or [[wmf:Resolution:Licensing policy|illegal]] uploading.
I propose to
* '''have [[Special:Upload|local upload]] [[commons:Commons:Turning off local uploads|restricted]]''' to the "{{int:group-sysop}}" group (for emergency uploads) and
* the '''sidebar point to [[commons:Special:UploadWizard]]''',
so that you can avoid local maintenance and all users can have a functioning, easy upload interface [[translatewiki:Special:Translate/ext-uploadwizard|in their own language]]. All registered users can upload on Commons and [[Special:ListFiles|existing files]] will not be affected.

I'll get this done in one week from now.

[[File:Media_Viewer_Desktop_-_Large_Image_Opaque_Info.png|thumb|Media Viewer lets you see images in larger size]]

Greetings— and sorry for writing in English, please translate if it will help your community,

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|Multimedia team]] is happy to announce that [[mw:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Media Viewer]] was just released on this site today. 

Media Viewer displays images in larger size when you click on their thumbnails, to provide a better viewing experience. Users can now view images faster and more clearly, without having to jump to separate pages — and its user interface is more intuitive, offering easy access to full-resolution images and information, with links to the file repository for editing. The tool has been tested extensively across all Wikimedia wikis over the past six months as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Feature]] and has been [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Release_Plan#Timeline|released]] to the largest Wikipedias, all language Wikisources, and the English Wikivoyage already.

If you do not like this feature, you can easily turn it off by clicking on "Disable Media Viewer" at the bottom of the screen, pulling up the information panel (or in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering|your preferences]]) whether you have an account or not. Learn more [[mw:Help:Multimedia/Media_Viewer#How_can_I_turn_off_this_feature.3F|in this Media Viewer Help page]].

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about Media Viewer.

== VisualEditor global newsletter—June 2014 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
This is a <u>one-time mailing</u> to projects that may need this information.  Future newsletters will be available as '''opt-in only'''. To receive future newsletters (about one per month), please '''add your page to the subscribers' list at [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter]]. You're welcome to translate to your language.'''

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">
The character formatting menu, or "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-style-tooltip}}" menu lets you set bold, italic, and other text styles.  "Clear formatting" removes all text styles and removes links to other pages.

Do you think that clear formatting should remove links?  Are there changes you would like to see for this menu?  [[:mw:Thread:VisualEditor/Feedback/Clearing formatting_and_links|Share your opinion at MediaWiki.org]].

[[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>
''The [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] team is mostly working to fix bugs, improve performance, reduce technical debt, and other infrastructure needs.  You can find [[:mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]] weekly updates detailing recent work.''

* They have moved the "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-command-help-title}}" link out of the "{{int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}}" menu, into the "{{int:visualeditor-help-tool}}" menu.  Within dialog boxes, buttons are now more accessible (via the Tab key) from the keyboard.
* You can now '''see the target of the link''' when you click on it, without having to open the inspector.
* The team also expanded '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal/TemplateData|TemplateData]]''': You can now add a parameter type  "<code>date"</code> for dates and times in the [[w:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] format, and  "<code>boolean"</code> for values which are true or false.  Also, templates that redirect to other templates (like <code><nowiki>{{citeweb}}</nowiki></code> → <code><nowiki>{{cite web}}</nowiki></code>) now get the TemplateData of their target ([[bugzilla:50964|bug 50964]]).  You can test TemplateData by editing [[:mw:Template:Sandbox/doc]].
* Category: and File: pages now display their contents correctly after saving an edit ([[bugzilla:65349|bug 65349]], [[bugzilla:64239|bug 64239]])
* They have also improved '''reference editing''':  You should no longer be able to add empty citations with VisualEditor (bug 64715), as with references.  When you edit a reference, you can now empty it and click the "use an existing reference" button to replace it with another reference instead. 
* It is now possible to edit '''inline images''' with VisualEditor.  Remember that inline images cannot display captions, so existing captions get removed.  Many other bugs related to images were also fixed.
*  You can now add and edit <code><nowiki>{{DISPLAYTITLE}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>__DISAMBIG__</nowiki></code> in  the "{{int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}}" menu, rounding out the full set of page options currently planned. 
* The tool to insert '''special characters''' is now wider and simpler.</div>

=== Looking ahead ===

The VisualEditor team has posted a draft of their goals for the next fiscal year.  You can read them and suggest changes [[:mw:Wikimedia Engineering/2014-15 Goals#Editing|on MediaWiki.org]].  

The team posts details about planned work on [[:mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor's roadmap]].  You will soon be able to '''drag-and-drop text''' as well as images.  If you drag an image to a new place, it won't let you place it in the middle of a paragraph.  All dialog boxes and windows will be simplified based on user testing and feedback.

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review ==
Hello. A new policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was recently adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] (your community received a notice about the discussion). According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on smaller wikis. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the new [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]] here.

We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#Effeietsanders (administrator)
#Tefo (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki. Thanks, '''[[User:Rschen7754|Rs]][[User talk:Rschen7754|chen]][[Special:Contributions/Rschen7754|7754]]''' 06:04, 11 Phukwi 2014 (UTC)

== Updates related to VisualEditor ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
:''Please help translate this message in your language. Thanks :) ''
Hi, everybody. This is a reminder that we invite you to discuss VisualEditor's recent development and plans ahead during the '''[[:m:IRC office hours|next office hours]]''' with James Forrester (Product Manager):
*[http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=9&min=00&sec=0&day=14&month=08&year=2014 Thursday, August 14, 9:00 UTC];

If you are not able to attend but have a question for James, you can leave your question [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|at mediawiki.org]] or on my talk page <u>by the day before</u>, and I will try to get a response. We plan to continue these monthly sessions as long as there is community interest, and to announce them through the '''[[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|VisualEditor global newsletter]]''' as well (please subscribe your talk page there to get the latest news about the software).

Most of the VisualEditor team will be at '''[https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimania in London]''' in August! You'll be able to meet the developers during the Hackaton or at the following sessions:
*[https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/VisualEditor_%E2%80%94_helping_users_edit_more_easily VisualEditor — helping users edit more easily], Saturday, August 9;
*[https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/VisualEditor_—_engineering_against_the_odds VisualEditor — engineering against the odds], Sunday, August 10.
WMF community liaisons will share a booth with community advocates at the Community Village and look forward to talking to you there. Thanks for your attention! --[[User:Elitre (WMF)]] 16:02, 31 Phukwi 2014 (UTC)

''The [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] team is currently working mostly to fix bugs, improve performance, reduce technical debt, and other infrastructure needs. You can find [[:mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]] weekly updates detailing recent work.''
[[File:VisualEditor - Link editing inline box.png|thumb|Dialog boxes in VisualEditor have been re-designed to use action words instead of icons.  This has increased the number of [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral#Translate the VisualEditor interface|items that need to be translated]].

[[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] is also being updated.
|alt=Screenshot of VisualEditor's link tool|240px]]

The biggest visible change since the last newsletter was to the dialog boxes.  '''The design for each dialog box and window was simplified.'''  The most commonly needed buttons are now at the top.  Based on user feedback, the buttons are now labeled with simple words (like "Cancel" or "Done") instead of potentially confusing icons (like "<" or "X").  Many of the buttons to edit links, images, and other items now also show the linked page, image name, or other useful information when you click on them.
* '''Hidden HTML comments''' (notes visible to editors, but not to readers) can now be read, edited, inserted, and removed.  A small icon (a white exclamation mark on a dot) marks the location of each comments.  You can click on the icon to see the comment.
* You can now '''drag and drop text''' and templates as well as images.  A new placement line makes it much easier to see where you are dropping the item.  Images can no longer be dropped into the middle of paragraphs.
* '''All references and footnotes ('''<code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code>''' tags) are now made through the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" menu''', including the "{{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-reference-tooltip}}" (manual formatting) footnotes and the ability to re-use an existing citation, both of which were previously accessible only through the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu.  The "{{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-referencelist-tooltip}}" is still added via the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu.
* When you add an image or other media file, you are now prompted to add an '''image caption''' immediately. You can also replace an image whilst keeping the original caption and other settings.
* All tablet users visiting the '''mobile web''' version of Wikipedias will be able to opt-in to a version of VisualEditor from 14 August.  You can test the new tool by choosing the beta version of the mobile view in the Settings menu.
* The '''link tool''' has a new "Open" button that will open a linked page in another tab so you can make sure a link is the right one. 
* The '''"Cancel" button''' in the toolbar has been removed based on user testing.  To cancel any edit, you can leave the page by clicking the Read tab, the back button in your browser, or closing the browser window without saving your changes.

== Letter petitioning WMF to reverse recent decisions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation recently created a new feature, "superprotect" status. The purpose is to prevent pages from being edited by elected administrators -- but permitting WMF staff to edit them. It has been put to use in only one case: to protect the deployment of the Media Viewer software on German Wikipedia, in defiance of a clear decision of that community to disable the feature by default, unless users decide to enable it.

If you oppose these actions, please add your name to this letter. If you know non-Wikimedians who support our vision for the free sharing of knowledge, and would like to add their names to the list, please ask them to sign an identical version of the letter on change.org.

== Process ideas for software development ==

<div class=”mw-content-ltr”>
’’My apologies for writing in English.’’

Hello,

I am notifying you that a brainstorming session has been [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)/Process ideas|started on Meta]] to help the Wikimedia Foundation increase and better affect community participation in software development across all wiki projects. Basically, how can you be more involved in helping to create features on Wikimedia projects?  We are inviting all interested users to voice their ideas on how communities can be more involved and informed in the product development process at the Wikimedia Foundation. It would be very appreciated if you could translate this message to help inform your local communities as well.

I and the rest of [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)|my team]] welcome you to participate. We hope to see you on Meta.

Kind regards,
-- [[m:User:Rdicerb (WMF)|Rdicerb (WMF)]] [[m:User talk:Rdicerb (WMF)|talk]] 22:15, 21 Phatwe 2014 (UTC)

== VisualEditor News #8—2014 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<div style="float:right;width:230px;margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200px|center]][[File:TemplateData GUI editor with two parameters.png|alt=|centre|frameless|230x230px]]'''Did you know?''' 
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">
TemplateData is a separate program that organizes information about the parameters that can be used in a template.  VisualEditor reads that data, and uses it to populate its simplified template dialogs.

With the new TemplateData editor, it is easier to add information about parameters, because the ones you need to use are pre-loaded. 

See [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]] for more information about adding TemplateData.  [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing]] team has reduced technical debt, simplified some workflows for template and citation editing, made major progress on Internet Explorer support, and fixed [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=349619&order=priority%252Cbug_severity&product=VisualEditor&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-14&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-21&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-28&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-04&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-11&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-18&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-25&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-02 over 125 bugs and requests]. Several performance improvements were made, especially to the system around re-using references and reference lists.  Weekly updates are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]]. 

There were three issues that required urgent fixes: a deployment error that meant that many buttons didn't work correctly (bugs [[bugzilla:69856|69856]] and [[bugzilla:69864|69864]]), a problem with edit conflicts that left the editor with nowhere to go ([[bugzilla:69150|bug 69150]]), and a problem in Internet Explorer 11 that replaced some categories with a link to the system message [[MediaWiki:Badtitletext]] ([[bugzilla:70894|bug 70894]]) when you saved. The developers apologize for the disruption, and thank the people who reported these problems quickly.

=== Increased support for devices and browsers ===
'''Internet Explorer 10 and 11 users now have access to VisualEditor'''. This means that about 5% of Wikimedia's users will now get an "Edit" tab alongside the existing "Edit source" tab.  Support for Internet Explorer 9 is planned for the future.

'''Tablet users''' browsing the site's mobile mode now have the option of using a mobile-specific form of VisualEditor. More editing tools, and availability of VisualEditor on smartphones, is planned for the future. The '''mobile version of VisualEditor''' was tweaked to show the context menu for citations instead of basic references ([[bugzilla:68897|bug 68897]]).  A bug that broke the editor in iOS was corrected and released early ([[bugzilla:68949|bug 68949]]). For mobile tablet users, three bugs related to scrolling were fixed ([[bugzilla:66697|bug 66697]], [[bugzilla:68828|bug 68828]], [[bugzilla:69630|bug 69630]]). You can use VisualEditor on the mobile version of Wikipedia from your tablet by clicking on the cog in the top-right when editing a page and choosing which editor to use.

=== TemplateData editor ===
'''The tool for editing [[mw:Extension:TemplateData|TemplateData]] has been deployed to 30 more Wikipedias this week.'''  Other Wikipedias and some other projects may receive access next month.  This tool makes it easier to add TemplateData to the template's documentation.  When the tool is enabled, it will add a button above every editing window for a template (including documentation subpages).  To use it, edit the template page or a subpage, and then click the "{{int:templatedata-editbutton}}" button at the top.  Read [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]].  You can test the TemplateData editor [[mw:Template:Sandbox/doc|in a sandbox at Mediawiki.org]].  Remember that TemplateData should be placed either on a documentation subpage '''''or''''' on the template page itself.  Only one block of TemplateData will be used per template.

=== Other changes ===
Several interface '''messages and labels were changed''' to be simpler, clearer, or shorter, based on feedback from translators and editors. The formatting of dialogs was changed, and more changes to the appearance will be coming soon, when VisualEditor implements the new MediaWiki theme from Design.  (A preview of the theme is [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|available on Labs]] for developers.)  The team also made some improvements for users of the '''Monobook''' skin that improved the size of text in toolbars and fixed selections that overlapped menus.

VisualEditor-MediaWiki now supplies the <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">mw-redirect</code> and <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">mw-disambig</code> class on '''links to redirects and disambiguation pages''', so that user gadgets that colour in these types of links can be created.

'''Templates' fields can be marked as '<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">required</code>' '''in TemplateData.  If a parameter is marked as required, then you cannot delete that field when you add a new template or edit an existing one ([[bugzilla:60358|bug 60358]]). 

Language support improved by making annotations use bi-directional isolation (so they display correctly with cursoring behaviour as expected) and by fixing a bug that crashed VisualEditor when trying to edit a page with a <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">dir</code> attribute but no <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">lang</code> set ([[bugzilla:69955|bug 69955]]). 

=== Looking ahead ===
The team posts details about planned work on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].  The VisualEditor team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' soon, perhaps in late October.        

The team is also working on support for '''adding rows and columns to tables''', and early work for this may appear within the month.  <mark>Please comment on the design [[:mw:VisualEditor/Design/Table editor#Design Workflow for comments|at Mediawiki.org]].</mark>

In the future, real-time collaborative editing may be possible in VisualEditor.  Some early preparatory work for this was recently done. 

=== Supporting your wiki ===

At Wikimania, several developers gave presentations about VisualEditor.  A translation sprint focused on improving access to VisualEditor was supported by many people.  '''Deryck Chan''' was the top translator.  Special honors also go to '''संजीव कुमार (Sanjeev Kumar)''', '''Robby''', '''Takot''', '''Bachounda''', '''Bjankuloski06''' and '''Ата'''.  A [[mw:VisualEditor/Translathon#Highlights from the Translathon|summary]] of the work achieved by the translation community is available.  Thank you all for your work.      

This was the first translatable VisualEditor newsletter, so thanks to everybody who made this possible! If it hasn't been delivered in your language, and you'd like to help with translations in the future, please subscribe to the [[mail:translators-l|Translators mailing list]] or contact <span class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">[[:m:User:Elitre (WMF)|Elitre (WMF)]]</span>, so that you will be notified when the next issue is due.      

VisualEditor can be made available to most non-Wikipedia projects.  If your community would like to test VisualEditor, please contact product manager <span class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">[[m:User talk:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]</span> or file an [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=VisualEditor&component=General enhancement request in Bugzilla].

== Meta RfCs on two new global groups ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello all, 

There are currently requests for comment open on meta to create two new global groups. The first is a group for members of the OTRS permissions queue, which would grant them autopatrolled rights on all wikis except those who opt-out. That proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Creation of a global OTRS-permissions user group]]. The second is a group for Wikimedia Commons admins and OTRS agents to view deleted file pages through the 'viewdeletedfile' right on all wikis except those who opt-out. The second proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Global file deletion review]].

We would like to hear what you think on both proposals. Both are in English; if you wanted to translate them into your native language that would also be appreciated.

It is possible for individual projects to opt-out, so that users in those groups do not have any additional rights on those projects. To do this please start a local discussion, and if there is consensus you can request to opt-out of either or both at [[m:Stewards' noticeboard]].

Thanks and regards, [[m:User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] ([[m:User talk:Ajraddatz|talk]]) 18:05, 26 Phalane 2014 (UTC)</div>

== Global AbuseFilter ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello,

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]] is a MediaWiki extension used to detect likely abusive behavior patterns, like pattern vandalism and spam. In 2013, [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter|Global AbuseFilters]] were enabled on a limited set of wikis including Meta-Wiki, MediaWiki.org, Wikispecies and (in early 2014) all the "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=small.dblist small wikis]". Recently, global abuse filters were enabled on "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=medium.dblist medium sized wikis]" as well. These filters are currently managed by stewards on Meta-Wiki and have shown to be very effective in preventing mass spam attacks across Wikimedia projects. However, there is currently no policy on how the global AbuseFilters will be managed although there are proposals. There is an ongoing [[m:Requests for comment/Global AbuseFilter|request for comment]] on policy governing the use of the global AbuseFilters. In the meantime, specific wikis can opt out of using the global AbuseFilter. These wikis can simply add a request to [[m:Global AbuseFilter/Opt-out wikis|this list]] on Meta-Wiki. More details can be found on [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter/2014 announcement|this page]] at Meta-Wiki. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [[m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter|m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter]].

VisualEditor is also available on the mobile version of Wikipedia. Log in and click the pencil icon to open the page you want to edit. Click on the gear-shaped settings button in the upper-right corner to pick which editor to use. Choose "{{int:Mobile-frontend-editor-visual-editor}}" to use VisualEditor, or "{{int:Mobile-frontend-editor-source-editor}}" to use the wikitext editor.

It will remember whether you used wikitext or VisualEditor, and use the same editor the next time you edit an article.  

[[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has information about how to use VisualEditor. Not all features are available on the mobile website.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=355757&product=VisualEditor&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-09&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-16&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-23%20%281.25wmf5%29&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-29%20%281.25wmf6%29 bugs and requests], and worked on support for editing tables and for using non-Latin languages. Their weekly updates are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]]. Informal notes from the recent quarterly review were posted [[m:WMF_Metrics_and_activities_meetings/Quarterly_reviews/Editing/October_2014|on Meta]]. 

=== Recent improvements ===
Basic support for '''inserting tables''' and changing the number of rows and columns in them was just introduced to Wikipedias. Advanced features, like dragging columns to different places, will be added later. 

To help editors find the most important items more quickly, some items in the toolbar menus are now hidden behind '''a "{{int:Ooui-toolbar-more}}" item''', such as "{{int:Visualeditor-annotationbutton-underline-tooltip}}" in the styling menu.

The French Wikipedia should see '''better search results''' for links, templates, and media because the [[:mw:Help:CirrusSearch|new search engine]] was turned on for everyone there. This change is expected at the Chinese and German Wikipedias this week, and the following week at the English Wikipedia. 

The "pawn" system has been mostly replaced. Bugs in this system sometimes added a chess pawn character to wikitext. The replacement provides better support for '''non-Latin languages''', with full support hopefully coming soon. 

VisualEditor is now provided to editors who use '''Internet Explorer''' 10 or 11 on desktop and mobile devices. Internet Explorer 9 is not supported yet.

The '''keyboard shortcuts''' for items in the toolbar menus are now shown in the menus.  

VisualEditor will replace the existing design with a '''new theme''' from the [[mw:Design|User Experience/Design group]]. The appearance of dialog boxes has already changed in the mobile version. The appearance on desktops will change soon. You are welcome to compare [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-apex-vector-ltr|the old "Apex" design]] and [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|the new "MediaWiki" theme]] which will replace it.

Several bugs were fixed for internal and external links. Improvements to MediaWiki's search solved an annoying problem: If you searched for the full name of the page or file that you wanted to link, sometimes the search engine could not find the page. A link inside a template to a local page that does not exist will now show red, exactly as it does when reading the page. Due to an error, for about two weeks this also affected all external links inside templates. Opening an auto-numbered link node like [http://example.com] with the keyboard used to open the wrong link tool. These problems have all been fixed.

=== TemplateData ===

'''The tool for quickly editing [[mw:Extension:TemplateData|TemplateData]] has been deployed to all Wikimedia Foundation wikis on Thursday, 6 November.''' This tool was already available on the biggest 40 Wikipedias, and now all wikis will have access to it. This tool makes it easier to add TemplateData to the template's documentation. When the tool is enabled, it will add a button above every editing window for a template (including documentation subpages). To use it, edit the template or a subpage, and then click the "{{int:templatedata-editbutton}}" button at the top. Read [[mw:Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]] to learn more about it. You can test the TemplateData editor [[mw:Template:Sandbox/doc|in a sandbox at Mediawiki.org]]. Remember that TemplateData should be placed either on a documentation subpage '''''or''''' on the template page itself. Only one block of TemplateData will be used per template.

You can use the '''new autovalue setting''' to pre-load a value into a template. This can be used to substitute dates, as in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=632356794&oldid=632356402 this example], or to add the most common value for that parameter. The autovalue can be overridden by the editor, by typing something else in the field.

In TemplateData, you may '''define a parameter as "required"'''.  The template dialog box in VisualEditor will warn editors if they leave a "required" parameter empty, and they will not be able to delete that parameter. If the template can function without this parameter, then please mark it as "{{int:Templatedata-doc-param-status-suggested}}" or "{{int:Templatedata-doc-param-status-optional}}" in TemplateData instead.

=== Looking ahead ===

The VisualEditor team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' soon. The appearance of the media search dialog will improve, to make picking between possible images easier and more visual. The team posts details about planned work on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].        

The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|user guide]] is being updated to add information about editing tables.
The translations of the user guide for most languages except Spanish, French, and Dutch are significantly out of date. '''Please help [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Help%3AVisualEditor%2FUser+guide&action=page&filter= complete the current translations]''' for users who speak your language.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on table editing and performance. Their weekly status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on mediawiki.org]]. Upcoming plans are posted at the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].

'''VisualEditor was deployed to several hundred remaining wikis''' as an opt-in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]] at the end of November, except for most Wiktionaries (which depend heavily upon templates) and all Wikisources (which await integration with [[mw:Extension:Proofread Page|ProofreadPage]]).

=== Recent improvements ===

Basic support for '''editing tables''' is now available. You can add and delete tables, add and remove rows and columns, set or remove a caption for a table, and merge cells together. To change the contents of a cell, double-click inside it. More features will be added in the coming months. In addition, VisualEditor now ignores broken, invalid <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">rowspan</code> and <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">colspan</code> elements, instead of trying to repair them.

You can now use '''find and replace''' in VisualEditor, reachable through the tool menu or by pressing <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">^ Ctrl</code></kbd>+<kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">F</code></kbd> or <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">⌘ Cmd</code></kbd>+<kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">F</code></kbd>.

You can now create and edit simple <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki><blockquote></nowiki></code> paragraphs for quoting and indenting content. This changes a "{{Int:Visualeditor-formatdropdown-format-paragraph}}" into a "{{Int:Visualeditor-formatdropdown-format-blockquote}}".

Some '''new keyboard sequences''' can be used to format content. At the start of the line, typing "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">* </code>" will make the line a bullet list; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">1.</code>" or "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">#</code>" will make it a numbered list; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">==</code>" will make it a section heading; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">: </code>" will make it a blockquote. If you didn't mean to use these tools, you can press undo to undo the formatting change.

There are also two other keyboard sequences: "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki>[[</nowiki></code>" for opening the link tool, and "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki>{{</nowiki></code>" for opening the template tool, to help experienced editors. The existing standard keyboard shortcuts, like <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">^ Ctrl</code></kbd>+<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">K</code> to open the link editor, still work. 

If you add a category that has been redirected, then VisualEditor now adds its target. Categories without description pages show up as red.

You can again create and edit '''galleries''' as wikitext code.

=== Looking ahead ===

The current VisualEditor design will be replaced with a '''new theme''' designed by the [[mw:Design|User Experience group]]. The new theme will be visible for desktop systems at mediawiki.org in late December and on other sites in early January. (You can see a developer preview of [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-apex-vector-ltr|the old "Apex" theme]] and [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|the new "MediaWiki" one]] which will replace it.)

The Editing team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' in January.

Planned changes to the media search dialog will make choosing between possible images easier.

[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|300px|right|frameless|alt=VisualEditor]]
Since the last newsletter, the  [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's appearance, the coming Citoid reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. 
Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on mediawiki.org]]. Upcoming plans are posted at the  [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].  

The Wikimedia Foundation has named [[:mw:Wikimedia_Engineering/2014-15_Goals#Top_departmental_priorities_for_Q3_.28January-March_2015.29|its top priorities for this quarter]] (January to March). The first priority is making VisualEditor ready for deployment by default to all new users and logged-out users at the remaining large Wikipedias. You can help identify these requirements. <mark>There will be weekly '''triage meetings '''which''' will be open to volunteers''' beginning Wednesday, 11 February 2015 at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150211T12&p1=224&ah=1 12:00 (noon) PST] (20:00 UTC). </mark> Tell Vice President of Engineering [[:foundation:User:Damon_Sicore_(WMF)|Damon Sicore]], Product Manager [[:mw:User:Jdforrester_(WMF)|James Forrester]] and other team members which bugs and features are most important to you. The decisions made at these meetings will determine what work is necessary for this quarter's goal of making VisualEditor ready for deployment to new users. The presence of volunteers who enjoy contributing MediaWiki code is particularly appreciated. Information about how to join the meeting will be posted at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]] shortly before the meeting begins. 

Due to some breaking changes in MobileFrontend and VisualEditor, VisualEditor was not working correctly on the mobile site for a couple of days in early January. The teams apologize for the problem. 

=== Recent improvements === 

The''' new design for VisualEditor''' aligns with MediaWiki's [[mw:Frontend standards group|Front-End Standards]] as led by the Design team. Several new versions of the [[mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]] library have also been released, and these also affect the appearance of VisualEditor and other MediaWiki software extensions. Most changes were minor, like changing the text size and the amount of white space in some windows. Buttons are consistently color-coded to indicate whether the action:
* starts a new task, like opening the {{int:visualeditor-toolbar-savedialog}} dialog: <span style="background-color: #015ccc; color:white"> blue </span>, 
* takes a constructive action, like inserting a citation:  <span style="background-color: #008c6d; color:white"> green </span>,
* might remove or lose your work, like removing a link:  <span style="background-color: #a7170f; color:white">  red </span>,  or  
* is neutral, like opening a link in a new browser window:  <span style="color: 757575">  gray </span>.  
The '''TemplateData editor''' has been completely re-written to use a different design based on the same OOjs UI system as VisualEditor.   ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T67815 T67815], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73746 T73746].) This change fixed a couple of existing bugs and improved usability. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73077 T73077], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73078 T73078].) 

'''Search and replace''' in long documents is now faster. It does not highlight every occurrence if there are more than 100 on-screen at once.([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T78234 T78234].)

Editors at the Hebrew and Russian Wikipedia requested the ability to use VisualEditor in the "Article Incubator" or drafts namespace. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T86688 T86688], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T87027 T87027].) If your community would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''' on your wiki, then you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.

=== Looking ahead === 

The Editing team will soon add '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. The '''[[mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[w:URL|URL]] or [[w:en: Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for ISBNs, PMIDs, and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to contribute to the Citoid service's definitions for each website, to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections.   

We will need editors to help test the '''new design of the special character inserter''', especially if you speak Welsh, Breton, or another language that uses diacritics or special characters extensively. The new version should be available for testing next week. Please contact [[:en:User:Whatamidoing (WMF)|User:Whatamidoing (WMF)]] if you would like to be notified when the new version is available. After the special character tool is completed, VisualEditor will be deployed to all users at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5 Wikipedias]]. This will affect about 50 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans, Azerbaijani, Breton, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Mongolian, Tatar, and Welsh'''. The date for this change has not been determined.

== Inspire Campaign: Improving diversity, improving content ==

This March, we’re organizing an Inspire Campaign to encourage and support new ideas for improving gender diversity on Wikimedia projects. Less than 20% of Wikimedia contributors are women, and many important topics are still missing in our content. We invite all Wikimedians to participate. If you have an idea that could help address this problem, please get involved today! The campaign runs until March 31.

All proposals are welcome - research projects, technical solutions, community organizing and outreach initiatives, or something completely new! Funding is available from the Wikimedia Foundation for projects that need financial support. Constructive, positive feedback on ideas is appreciated, and collaboration is encouraged - your skills and experience may help bring someone else’s project to life. Join us at the Inspire Campaign and help this project better represent the world’s knowledge!

== Stewards confirmation rules ==

Hello, I made [[:m:Requests_for_comment/Confirmation_of_stewards|a proposal on Meta]] to change the rules for the steward confirmations.

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's performance, the [[:mw:Citoid|Citoid]] reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. Status reports are posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on Mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

The weekly '''task triage meetings''' continue to be open to volunteers, each Wednesday at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150401T11&p1=224&am=30 11:00 (noon) PDT] (18:00 UTC).  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|Editing team's Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]]. 
=== Recent improvements ===
VisualEditor is now substantially faster.  In many cases, opening the page in VisualEditor is now faster than opening it in the wikitext editor. The new system has improved the code speed by 37% and [[:mw:RESTBase|network speed]] by almost 40%.

The Editing team is slowly adding '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. This is currently available only at the French, Italian, and English Wikipedias.  The '''[[:mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for [[:en:ISBN|ISBNs]], [[:en:PubMed#PubMed_identifier|PMIDs]], and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections by contributing to the Citoid service's definitions for each website.

Citoid requires good [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your citation templates.  If you would like to request this feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the TemplateData for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

The '''special character inserter''' has been improved, based upon feedback from active users.  After this, VisualEditor was made available to all users of Wikipedias on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5]] list on 30 March.  This affected 53 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans''', '''Azerbaijani''', '''Breton''', '''Kyrgyz''', '''Macedonian''', '''Mongolian''', '''Tatar''', and''' Welsh'''. 

Work continues to support languages with complex requirements, such as Korean and Japanese.  These languages use [[w:input method editor|input method editors]] ("IMEs”).  Recent improvements to cursoring, backspace, and delete behavior will simplify typing in VisualEditor for these users.

The design for the image selection process is now using a "masonry fit" model.  Images in the search results are displayed at the same height but at variable widths, similar to bricks of different sizes in a masonry wall, or the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Images#Mode parameter|"packed" mode in image galleries]].  This style helps you find the right image by making it easier to see more details in images.

You can now '''drag and drop categories''' to re-arrange their order of appearance ​on the page.

The pop-up window that appears when you click on a reference, image, link, or other element, is called the "context menu".  It now displays additional useful information, such as the destination of the link or the image's filename.  The team has also added an explicit "Edit" button in the context menu, which helps new editors open the tool to change the item.

'''Invisible templates are marked by a puzzle piece icon''' so they can be interacted with. Users also will be able to see and edit HTML anchors now in section headings.

Users of the TemplateData GUI editor can now set a string as an optional text for the 'deprecated' property in addition to boolean value, which lets you tell users of the template what they should do instead. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90734 T90734])

=== Looking ahead ===
The special character inserter in VisualEditor will soon use the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki will also have the option of creating a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Instructions for customizing the list will be posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].

The team is discussing a test of VisualEditor with new users at the English Wikipedia, to see whether they have met their goals of making VisualEditor suitable for those editors.  The timing is unknown, but might be relatively soon. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90666 T90666])

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation logo - vertical (2012-2016).svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.  One position is being filled.  More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC Ombudsperson elections/2015|the FDC Ombudsperson elections page]]. 

The candidacy submission phase lasts from 00:00 UTC April 20 to 23:59 UTC May 5 for the Board and from 00:00 UTCApril 20 to 23:59 UTC April 30 for the FDC and FDC Ombudsperson. This year, we are accepting both self-nominations and nominations of others. More information on this election and the nomination process can be found on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|the 2015 Wikimedia elections page on Meta-Wiki]].

Please feel free to post a note about the election on your project's village pump. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the talk page on Meta, or sent to the election committee's mailing list, board-elections -at- wikimedia.org

== Content Translation now available as a beta feature on this Wikipedia ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Hello, we enabled [[mw:Content_translation|Content Translation]] today as a beta feature on this Wikipedia. Content Translation is a tool that will help editors quickly create new articles by translating from a Wikipedia page in another language. The tool is currently in use in over [[mw:Content_translation/Languages#Available_languages|40 Wikipedias]] as a beta feature. To start translating, you will have to enable the beta feature and go to [[Special:ContentTranslation]] or to your contributions page and create a new translation by selecting the source language, the article name you wish to translate and target language i.e. the language of the new article you are creating. If the article already exists then a warning will be displayed. After you translate the article, you can publish it directly as a new page on the Wikipedia. In case the article gets created by another user while you were translating, you will see an option to save the newly published translation under your user namespace. The number of published pages can be seen on the [[Special:CXStats|Content Translation stats page]].

Since, this is the first time we have installed the tool on this Wikipedia, there are chances that there may be some problems or service disruptions which we are not yet aware of. We will be monitoring the usage to check for any failures or issues, but please do let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Content Translation talk page]] or through [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97540 Phabricator] if you spot any problems that prevent you from using the tool. For more information, please read [[:mw:Content_translation#Try_the_tool|about how to use the tool]]. You can also view a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Content_Translation_Screencast_%28English%29.webm short screencast] on how to use Content Translation.

== Pywikibot compat will no longer be supported - Please migrate to pywikibot core ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<small>Sorry for English, I hope someone translates this.</small><br />
[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot|Pywikibot]] (then "Pywikipediabot") was started back in 2002. In 2007 a new branch (formerly known as "rewrite", now called "core") was started from scratch using the MediaWiki API. The developers of Pywikibot have decided to stop supporting the compat version of Pywikibot due to bad performance and architectural errors that make it hard to update, compared to core.  If you are using pywikibot compat it is likely your code will break due to upcoming MediaWiki API changes (e.g. [[phab:T101524|T101524]]). It is highly recommended you migrate to the core framework. There is a  [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/Compat deprecation|migration guide]], and please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot/Communication|contact us]] if you have any problem.

There is an upcoming MediaWiki API breaking change that compat will not be updated for. If your bot's name is in [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/081931.html this list], your bot will most likely break.

Thank you,<br />

<br><br>

[[File:VisualEditor link tool 2015.png|alt=Screenshot of the link inspector|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
<br>
There are separate tabs for linking to internal and external pages.
[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has created new interfaces for the link and citation tools and fixed many bugs and changed some elements of the design.  Some of these bugs affected users of VisualEditor on mobile devices. Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|test of VisualEditor's effect on new editors]] at the English Wikipedia has just completed the first phase.  During this test, half of newly registered editors had VisualEditor automatically enabled, and half did not.  The main goal of the study is to learn which group was more likely to save an edit and to make productive, unreverted edits.  Initial [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study#Results|results will be posted at Meta]] later this month.    
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features''' '''for citations''' are available at a few Wikipedias through the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]'''.  Citoid takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation.  If Citoid is enabled on your wiki, then the design of the citation workflow changed during May.  All citations are now created inside a single tool.  Inside that tool, choose the tab you want ({{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-auto}}, {{int: citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-manual}}, or {{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-reuse}}).  The cite button is now labeled with the word "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" rather than a book icon, and the autofill citation dialog now has a more meaningful label, "{{Int:Citoid-citeFromIDDialog-lookup-button}}", for the submit button.

The '''link tool''' has been redesigned based on feedback from Wikipedia editors and user testing.  It now has two separate sections:  one for links to articles and one for external links. When you select a link, its pop-up context menu shows the name of the linked page, a thumbnail image from the linked page, Wikidata's description, and appropriate icons for disambiguation pages, redirect pages and empty pages (where applicable). Search results have been reduced to the first five pages.  Several bugs were fixed, including a dark highlight that appeared over the first match in the link inspector.  ([[phab:T98085|T98085]])

The '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor now uses the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki can also create a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Please read the instructions for customizing the list [[mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].  Also, there is now a tooltip to describing each character in the special character inserter. ([[phab:T70425|T70425]])

Several improvements have been made to '''templates'''.  When you search for a template to insert, the list of results now contains descriptions of the templates. The parameter list inside the template dialog now remains open after inserting a parameter from the list, so that users don’t need to click on "{{Int:visualeditor-dialog-transclusion-add-param}}" each time they want to add another parameter.  ([[phab:T95696|T95696]]) The team added a '''new property for TemplateData''', "{{int: templatedata-doc-param-example}}", for template parameters.  This optional, translatable property will show up when there is text describing how to use that parameter. ([[phab:T53049|T53049]])

The '''design''' of the main toolbar and several other elements have changed slightly, to be consistent with the MediaWiki theme.  In the Vector skin, individual items in the menu are separated visually by pale gray bars.  Buttons and menus on the toolbar can now contain both an icon and a text label, rather than just one or the other. This new design feature is being used for the cite button on wikis where the Citoid service is enabled.

The team has released a long-desired improvement to the handling of '''non-existent images'''.  If a non-existent image is linked in an article, then it is now visible in VisualEditor and can be selected, edited, replaced, or removed.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=VisualEditor/Feedback&lqt_method=talkpage_new_thread mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Wednesday at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|VisualEditor Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  
* If your Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, or other community wants to have VisualEditor made available by default to contributors, then please contact [[:m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]. 
* If you would like to request the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]]  for the most important citation templates on your wiki. 
*The team is planning the second VisualEditor-related "translathon" for July. Please follow [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91108 this task on Phabricator] for details and updates! Announcements will follow in due course.

Hi everyone.

Over the last few years, the Wikimedia Foundation has [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/ been working] towards enabling [[m:Special:MyLanguage/HTTPS|HTTPS]] by default for all users, including unregistered ones, for better privacy and security for both readers and editors. This has taken a long time, as there were different aspects to take into account. Our servers haven't been ready to handle it. The Wikimedia Foundation has had to balance sometimes conflicting goals.

[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Forced HTTPS] has just been implemented on all Wikimedia projects. Some of you might already be aware of this, as a few Wikipedia language versions were converted to HTTPS last week and the then affected communities were notified.

Most of Wikimedia editors shouldn't be affected at all. If you edit as registered user, you've probably already had to log in through HTTPS.

This change would affect all wikis, so if you support/oppose or want to give general feedback/concerns, please post them to the [[w:c:Commons:Village_pump/Proposals#Create_PNG_thumbnails_of_static_GIF_images|proposal page]]. Thank you. --[[w:c:User:McZusatz|McZusatz]] ([[w:c:User talk:McZusatz|talk]]) & [[User:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[User talk:MediaWiki message delivery|talk]]) 06:21, 24 Phukwi 2015 (UTC)

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is coming ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

When using data from Wikidata on Wikipedia and other sister projects, there is currently a limitation in place that hinders some use cases: data can only be accessed from the corresponding item. So, for example, the Wikipedia article about Berlin can only get data from the Wikidata item about Berlin but not from the item about Germany. This had technical reasons. We are now removing this limitation. It is already done for many projects. Your project is one of the next ones. We will roll out this feature here on August 12.

We invite you to play around with this new feature if you are one of the people who have been waiting for this for a long time. If you have technical issues/questions with this you can come to [[d:Wikidata:Contact the development team]].

A note of caution: Please be careful with how many items you use for a single page. If it is too many pages, loading might get slow. We will have to see how the feature behaves in production to see where we need to tweak and how.

How to use it, once it is enabled:
* Parser function: <nowiki>{{#property:P36|from=Q183}}</nowiki> to get the capital from the item about Germany
* Lua: see [[mw:Extension:Wikibase Client/Lua]]

Hi everyone,

As I have previously announced here we have now enabled the arbitrary access feature here. This means from now on you can make use of data from any Wikidata item in any article here. Before you could for example only access data about Berlin in the article about Berlin. If you want to find out more or have questions please come to [[d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access]]. I hope this will open up great possibilities for you and make your work easier.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] have been working on mobile phone support. They have fixed many bugs and improved language support.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving language support and functionality on mobile devices.   

=== Wikimania ===
The team attended Wikimania 2015 in Mexico City. There they participated in the Hackathon and met with individuals and groups of users. They also made several presentations about [[c:File:How_we_made_VisualEditor_faster.pdf|VisualEditor]] and the [[:c:File:Wikimania_2015_–_Editing_Department_–_Beyond_Editing.pdf|future of editing]]. 

Following Wikimania, we announced winners for the [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon VisualEditor 2015 Translathon]. Our thanks and congratulations to users ''Halan-tul'', ''Renessaince'', ''<span lang="ne" dir="ltr">जनक राज भट्ट</span> (Janak Bhatta)'', ''Vahe Gharakhanyan'', ''Warrakkk'', and ''Eduardogobi''.

For '''interface messages''' (translated at [https://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net]), we saw the initiative affecting 42 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 56.5% before the translathon, and 78.2% after ('''+21.7%'''). In particular, Sakha improved from 12.2% to 94.2%; Brazilian Portuguese went from 50.6% to 100%; Taraškievica went from 44.9% to 85.3%; Doteli went from 1.3% to 41.2%. Also, while 1.7% of the messages were outdated across all languages before the translathon, the percentage dropped to 0.8% afterwards (-0.9%).   

For '''documentation messages''' (on mediawiki.org), we saw the initiative affecting 24 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 26.6% before translathon, and 46.9% after ('''+20.3%''').  There were particularly notable achievements for three languages. Armenian improved from 1% to 99%; Swedish, from 21% to 99%, and Brazilian Portuguese, from 34% to 83%. Outdated translations across all languages were reduced from 8.4% before translathon to 4.8% afterwards (-3.6%).   

[https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon#Graphs_(interface_messages_only) We published some graphs] showing the effect of the event on the Translathon page. We thank the translators for participating and the translatewiki.net staff for facilitating this initiative.   

=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features for citations''' can be enabled on each Wikipedia.  The tool uses the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]''' to convert a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] into a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. You can see an animated GIF of the quick, [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/GIFs#Auto-citing_a_source|simple process at mediawiki.org]].  So far, about a dozen Wikipedias have enabled the auto-citation tool.  To enable it for your wiki, follow the [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling_Citoid_on_your_wiki|instructions at mediawiki.org]].

Your wiki can customize the first section of the '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor. Please follow the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Special_characters|instructions at mediawiki.org]] to put the characters you want at the top. 
In other changes, if you need to fill in a [[:mw:CAPTCHA|CAPTCHA]] and get it wrong, then you can click to get a new one to complete.  VisualEditor can now display and edit [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:Graph|Vega-based graphs]]. If you use the Monobook skin, VisualEditor's appearance is now more consistent with other software.     

=== Future changes ===
The team will be changing the '''appearance of selected links''' inside VisualEditor. The purpose is to make it easy to see whether your cursor is inside or outside the link.  When you select a link, the link label (the words shown on the page) will be enclosed in a faint box.  If you place your cursor inside the box, then your changes to the link label will be part of the link.  If you place your cursor outside the box, then it will not.  This will make it easy to know when new characters will be added to the link and when they will not.

On the English Wikipedia, 10% of newly created accounts are now offered both the visual and the wikitext editors.  A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|recent controlled trial]] showed no significant difference in survival or productivity for new users in the short term.  New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs, added new features, and made some small design changes.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages like Japanese and Arabic, making it easier to edit on mobile devices, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Educational features:''' The first time ever you use the visual editor, it now draws your attention to the {{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-link-tooltip}} and {{Int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}} tools.  When you click on the tools, it explains why you should use them. ([[Phab:T108620|T108620]]) Alongside this, the welcome message for new users has been simplified to make editing more welcoming. ([[Phab:T112354|T112354]])  More in-software educational features are planned.  

'''Links:'''  It is now easier to understand when you are adding text to a link and when you are typing plain text next to it. ([[Phab:T74108|T74108]], [[Phab:T91285|T91285]])  The editor now fully supports ISBN, PMID or RFC numbers. ([[Phab:T109498|T109498]], [[Phab:T110347|T110347]], [[Phab:T63558|T63558]])  These  [[:en:Help:Magic_links|"magic links"]] use a custom link editing tool.  

'''Uploads:'''  Registered editors can now '''upload images''' and other media to Commons while editing.  Click the new tab in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}} {{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-media-tooltip}}" tool.  You will be guided through the process without having to leave your edit.  At the end, the image will be inserted. This tool is limited to one file at a time, owned by the user, and licensed under Commons's standard license.  For more complex situations, the tool links to more advanced upload tools.  You can also drag the image into the editor.  This will be available in the wikitext editor later. 

'''Mobile:'''  Previously, the visual editor was available on the mobile Wikipedia site only on tablets. Now, editors can use it on all devices regardless of size if they wish. ([[Phab:T85630|T85630]])  Edit conflicts were previously broken on the mobile website. Edit conflicts can now be resolved in both wikitext and visual editors. ([[Phab:T111894|T111894]])  Sometimes templates and similar items could not be deleted on the mobile website.  Selecting them caused the on-screen keyboard to hide with some browsers.  Now there is a new "{{int:Visualeditor-contextitemwidget-label-remove}}" button, so that these things can be removed if the keyboard hides. ([[Phab:T62110|T62110]]) You can also edit table cells in mobile now.

'''Rich editing tools:'''  You can now add and edit '''sheet''' '''music''' in the visual editor. ([[Phab:T112925|T112925]])  There are separate tabs for advanced options, such as MIDI and Ogg audio files. ([[Phab:T114227|T114227]], [[Phab:T113354|T113354]])  When editing '''formulæ''' and other blocks, errors are shown as you edit.  It is also possible to edit some types of '''graphs'''; adding new ones, and support for new types, will be coming. 

On the '''English Wikipedia''', the visual editor is now automatically available to anyone who creates an account.  The preference switch was moved to the normal location, under [[Special:Preferences]].
=== Future changes ===
You will soon be able to '''switch from the wikitext to the visual editor''' after you start editing. ([[phab:T49779|T49779]]) Previously, you could only switch from the visual editor to the wikitext editor.  Bi-directional switching will make possible a '''single edit tab.''' ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) This project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, similar to the system already used on the mobile website.  The "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.

=== Let's work together ===

== Community Wishlist Survey ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 

Hi everyone! Apologies for posting in English. Translations are very welcome.

The [[:m:Community Tech|Community Tech team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation is focused on building improved curation and moderation tools for experienced Wikimedia contributors. We're now starting a '''[[:m:2015 Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]]''' to find the most useful projects that we can work on.

For phase 1 of the survey, we're inviting all active contributors to submit brief proposals, explaining the project that you'd like us to work on, and why it's important. Phase 1 will last for 2 weeks. In phase 2, we'll ask you to vote on the proposals. Afterwards, we'll analyze the top 10 proposals and create a prioritized wishlist.

While most of this process will be conducted in English, we're inviting people from any Wikimedia wiki to submit proposals. We'll also invite volunteer translators to help translate proposals into English. 

Your proposal should include: the problem that you want to solve, who would benefit, and a proposed solution, if you have one. You can submit your proposal on the Community Wishlist Survey page, using the entry field and the big blue button. We will be accepting proposals for 2 weeks, ending on November 23.
 
We're looking forward to hearing your ideas!

== Wikimania 2016 scholarships ambassadors needed ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hello! [[wm2016:|Wikimania 2016]] scholarships will soon be open; by the end of the week we'll form the committee and we need your help, see [[wm2016:Special:MyLanguage/Scholarship committee|Scholarship committee]] for details.

If you want to carefully review nearly a thousand applications in January, you might be a perfect committee member. Otherwise, you can '''volunteer as "ambassador"''': you will observe all the committee activities, ensure that people from your language or project manage to apply for a scholarship, translate '''scholarship applications written in your language''' to English and so on. Ambassadors are allowed to ask for a scholarship, unlike committee members.

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Your input requested on the proposed #FreeBassel banner campaign]] ==

''This is a message regarding the [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|proposed 2015 Free Bassel banner]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Translations]] are available.''

Hi everyone,

This is to inform all Wikimedia contributors that a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|straw poll seeking your involvement]] has just been started on Meta-Wiki.

As some of your might be aware, a small group of Wikimedia volunteers have proposed a banner campaign informing Wikipedia readers about the urgent situation of our fellow Wikipedian, open source software developer and Creative Commons activist, [[:w:Bassel Khartabil|Bassel Khartabil]]. An exemplary [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|banner]] and an [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|explanatory page]] have now been prepared, and translated into about half a dozen languages by volunteer translators.

We are seeking [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|your involvement to decide]] if the global Wikimedia community approves starting a banner campaign asking Wikipedia readers to call on the Syrian government to release Bassel from prison. We understand that a campaign like this would be unprecedented in Wikipedia's history, which is why we're seeking the widest possible consensus among the community.

Given Bassel's urgent situation and the resulting tight schedule, we ask everyone to [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|get involved with the poll and the discussion]] to the widest possible extent, and to promote it among your communities as soon as possible.

(Apologies for writing in English; please kindly [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|translate]] this message into your own language.)

Thank you for your participation!

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Get involved in Wikipedia 15!]] ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/MassMessages/Get involved|Translations]] are available.''

[[File:International-Space-Station wordmark blue.svg|right|200px]]

As many of you know, January 15 is Wikipedia’s 15th Birthday!

People around the world are getting involved in the celebration and have started adding their [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|events on Meta Page]]. While we are celebrating Wikipedia's birthday, we hope that all projects and affiliates will be able to utilize this celebration to raise awareness of our community's efforts.

Haven’t started planning? Don’t worry, there’s lots of ways to get involved. Here are some ideas:

* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|Join/host an event]]'''. We already have more than 80, and hope to have many more.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media|Talk to local press]]'''. In the past 15 years, Wikipedia has accomplished extraordinary things. We’ve made a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/15 years|handy summary]] of milestones and encourage you to add your own. More resources, including a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media#releases|press release template]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Communications/Movement Communications Skills|resources on working with the media]], are also available.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Material|Design a Wikipedia 15 logo]]'''. In place of a single icon for Wikipedia 15, we’re making dozens. Add your own with something fun and representative of your community. Just use the visual guide so they share a common sensibility.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events/Package#birthdaywish|Share a message on social media]]'''. Tell the world what Wikipedia means to you, and add #wikipedia15 to the post. We might re-tweet or share your message!

Everything is linked on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Wikipedia 15 Meta page]]. You’ll find a set of ten data visualization works that you can show at your events, and a [[c:Category:Wikipedia15 Mark|list of all the Wikipedia 15 logos]] that community members have already designed.

If you have any questions, please contact [[m:User:ZMcCune (WMF)|Zachary McCune]] or [[m:User:JSutherland (WMF)|Joe Sutherland]].

Thanks and Happy nearly Wikipedia 15!<br />
-The Wikimedia Foundation Communications team

A new, simpler system for editing will offer a single Edit button.  Once the page has opened, you can switch back and forth between visual and wikitext editing.      

[[File:VisualEditor single edit tab preference dialog.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up dialog for switching from the wikitext editor to the visual editor|centre|frameless|230x230px]]<br>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|visual editor team]] has fixed many bugs and expanded the mathematics formula tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages such as Japanese and Arabic, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   

=== Recent improvements ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing.    
The '''LaTeX mathematics formula editor''' has been significantly expanded. ([[phab:T118616|T118616)]] You can see the formula as you change the LaTeX code.  You can click buttons to insert the correct LaTeX code for many symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''single edit tab''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, like the system already used on the mobile website.  ([[phab:T102398|T102398]], [[phab:T58337|T58337]])  Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.  Your last editing choice will be stored as a cookie for logged-out users and as an account preference for logged-in editors.  Logged-in editors will be able to set a default editor in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]] in the drop-down menu about "{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}".   

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the following Wikipedias in early 2016:  [[w:am:|Amharic]], [[w:bug:|Buginese]], [[w:cdo:|Min Dong]], [[w:cr:|Cree]], [[w:gv:|Manx]], [[w:hak:|Hakka]], [[w:hy:|Armenian]], [[w:ka:|Georgian]], [[w:pnt:|Pontic]], [[w:sh:|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:ti:|Tigrinya]], [[w:xmf:|Mingrelian]], [[w:za:|Zhuang]], and [[w:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]]. ([[phab:T116523|T116523]]) Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  

In 2016, the '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor on many Wikipedias will be redirected to mediawiki.org. ([[phab:T92661|T92661]])

=== Testing opportunities ===
* Please try the new system for the '''single edit tab''' on [https://test2.wikipedia.org test2.wikipedia.org].  You can edit while logged out to see how it works for logged-out editors, or you can create a separate account to be able to set your account's preferences.  <mark>Please share your thoughts about the single edit tab system at [[mediawikiwiki:Topic:Suspcq0bf5nd3gsd|the feedback topic on mediawiki.org]] or [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for formal user research]</mark> (type "single edit tab" in the question about other areas you're interested in).  The new system has not been finalized, and your feedback can affect the outcome.  The team particularly wants your thoughts about the options in Special:Preferences. The current choices in Special:Preferences are:
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}, 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}.  (This is the current state for people already using the visual editor.  None of these options will be visible if you have disabled the visual editor in your preferences at that wiki.)

The '''LaTeX mathematics formula editor''' has been significantly expanded. ([[phab:T118616|T118616)]] You can see the formula as you change the LaTeX code.  You can click buttons to insert the correct LaTeX code for many symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''single edit tab''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, like the system already used on the mobile website.  ([[phab:T102398|T102398]], [[phab:T58337|T58337]])  Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.  Your last editing choice will be stored as a cookie for logged-out users and as an account preference for logged-in editors.  Logged-in editors will be able to set a default editor in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]] in the drop-down menu about "{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}".   

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the following Wikipedias in early 2016:  [[w:am:|Amharic]], [[w:bug:|Buginese]], [[w:cdo:|Min Dong]], [[w:cr:|Cree]], [[w:gv:|Manx]], [[w:hak:|Hakka]], [[w:hy:|Armenian]], [[w:ka:|Georgian]], [[w:pnt:|Pontic]], [[w:sh:|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:ti:|Tigrinya]], [[w:xmf:|Mingrelian]], [[w:za:|Zhuang]], and [[w:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]]. ([[phab:T116523|T116523]]) Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  

In 2016, the '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor on many Wikipedias will be redirected to mediawiki.org. ([[phab:T92661|T92661]])

=== Testing opportunities ===
* Please try the new system for the '''single edit tab''' on [https://test2.wikipedia.org test2.wikipedia.org].  You can edit while logged out to see how it works for logged-out editors, or you can create a separate account to be able to set your account's preferences.  <mark>Please share your thoughts about the single edit tab system at [[mediawikiwiki:Topic:Suspcq0bf5nd3gsd|the feedback topic on mediawiki.org]] or [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for formal user research]</mark> (type "single edit tab" in the question about other areas you're interested in).  The new system has not been finalized, and your feedback can affect the outcome.  The team particularly wants your thoughts about the options in Special:Preferences. The current choices in Special:Preferences are:
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}, 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}.  (This is the current state for people already using the visual editor.  None of these options will be visible if you have disabled the visual editor in your preferences at that wiki.)  
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|What to test]] if you can help, and report it on Phabricator ([[phab:T110654|Korean]] - [[phab:T109818|Japanese]]) or on Wikipedia ([[:ko:위키백과:시각편집기/IME|Korean]] - [[:ja:Wikipedia:ビジュアルエディター/フィードバック/IME|Japanese]]).

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[User:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[User talk:MediaWiki message delivery|talk]]) 19:07, 18 Firikgong 2016 (UTC)

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

Among experienced editors, the visual editor's table editing is one of the most popular features.
[[File:VisualEditor table menu move column.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up menu for column operations in a table|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
If you select the top of a column or the end of a row, you can quickly insert and remove columns and rows.  

Now, you can also rearrange columns and rows. Click "Move before" or "Move after" to swap the column or row with its neighbor.
You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Indic, and Han scripts, and improving the single edit tab interface.   

=== Recent changes ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing. This function is available to nearly all editors at most wikis except the Wiktionaries and Wikisources.    

Many local '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor have been redirected to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].

You can now re-arrange columns and rows in '''tables''', as well as copying a row, column or any other selection of cells and pasting it in a new location.    

The '''formula editor''' has two options: you can choose "Quick edit" to see and change only the LaTeX code, or "Edit" to use the full tool. The full tool offers immediate preview and an extensive list of symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab. 
This is similar to the system already used on the mobile website. ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time. Your last editing choice will be stored as an account preference for logged-in editors, and as a cookie for logged-out users.

* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}},
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}. (This is the state for people using the visual editor now.)
The visual editor uses the same search engine as [[Special:Search]] to find links and files. This search will get better at detecting typos and spelling mistakes soon. These improvements to search will appear in the visual editor as well.

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at most [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. This will affect the following languages, amongst others: 
[[:w:ja: |'''Japanese''']], [[:w:ko:|'''Korean''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']].
 
=== Let's work together ===
* Please try out the newest version of the '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' on [[test2wiki:Special:Random|test2.wikipedia.org]]. You may need to restore the default preferences (at the bottom of [[test2wiki:Special:Preferences]]) to see the initial prompt for options.

== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

== Server switch 2016 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its newest data center in Dallas.
This will make sure Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.
To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems.

They will switch all traffic to the new data center on '''Tuesday, 19 April'''.<br/>
On '''Thursday, 21 April''', they will switch back to the primary data center.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.
We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future.

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 15 to 30 minutes on Tuesday, 19 April and Thursday, 21 April, starting at 14:00 UTC (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT).

If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.
We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.
If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.
Then you should be able to save your edit.
But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped.
Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal.
If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual.
Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be a code freeze for the week of 18 April.
No non-essential code deployments will take place.

This test was originally planned to take place on March 22.
April 19th and 21st are the new dates. 
You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for Q3 FY2015-2016 rollout|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]].
They will post any changes on that schedule.
There will be more notifications about this.

== Compact Language Links enabled in this wiki today ==

{{int:Please-translate}}
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). Based on several factors, this shorter list of languages is expected to be more relevant for them and valuable for finding similar content in a language known to them. More information about compact language links can be found in [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|the documentation]].

From today onwards, compact language links has been enabled as the default listing of interlanguage links on this wiki. Using the button at the bottom, you will be able to see a longer list of all the languages the article has been written in. The setting for this compact list can be changed by using the checkbox under ''User Preferences -> Appearance -> Languages''

The compact language links feature has been tested extensively by the Wikimedia Language team, which developed it. However, in case there are any problems or other feedback please let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project talk page]] or on this discussion thread. It is to be noted that on some wikis the presence of an existing older gadget that was used for a similar purpose may cause an interference for compact language list. We would like to bring this to the attention of the admins of this wiki. Full details are on [[phab:T131455|this phabricator ticket]] (in English).

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you.

== Wikipedia to the Moon: invitation to edit ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity. Please feel kindly invited to edit on behalf of your community and tell us about your work on featured content!

[[File:VisualEditor References List Insert Menu-en.png|alt=Screenshot showing a dropdown menu with many items|center|frameless|150px]]  

Place the cursor where you want to display the references list (usually at the bottom of the page).  Open the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu and click the "{{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}" icon (three books).

If you are using several groups of references, which is relatively rare, you will have the opportunity to specify the group. If you do that, then only the references that belong to the specified group will be displayed in this list of references.
Finally, click "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-action-insert}}" in the dialog to insert the {{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}.  This list will change as you add more footnotes to the page.

You can read and help translate [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

== Save/Publish ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[:mw:Editing|Editing]] team is planning to change the name of the [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] button to [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”]. “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” will be used when you create a new page. “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>” will be used when you change an existing page. The names will be consistent in all editing environments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131132][https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]

This change will probably happen during the week of 30 August 2016. The change will be announced in [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/News|Tech News]] when it happens.

If you are fluent in a language other than English, please check the status of translations at translatewiki.net for [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”].

The main reason for this change is to avoid confusion for new editors. Repeated user research studies with new editors have shown that some new editors believed that [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] would save a private copy of a new page in their accounts, rather than permanently publishing their changes on the web. It is important for this part of the user interface to be clear, since it is difficult to remove public information after it is published. We believe that the confusion caused by the “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>” button increases the workload for experienced editors, who have to clean up the information that people unintentionally disclose, and report it to the functionaries and stewards to suppress it. Clarifying what the button does will reduce this problem.

Beyond that, the goal is to make all the wikis and languages more consistent, and some wikis made this change many years ago. The [[:m:Legal|Legal team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation supports this change. Making the edit interface easier to understand will make it easier to handle licensing and privacy questions that may arise. 

Any help pages or other basic documentation about how to edit pages will also need to be updated, on-wiki and elsewhere. On wiki pages, you can use the wikitext codes <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishpage}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishchanges}}</nowiki></code> to display the new labels in the user's preferred language. For the language settings in [[Special:Preferences|your account preferences]], these wikitext codes produce “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” and “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>”.

Please share this news with community members who teach new editors and with others who may be interested.

We are having a problem with attackers taking over wiki accounts with privileged user rights (for example, admins, bureaucrats, oversighters, checkusers). It appears that this may be because of weak or reused passwords.

Community members are working along with members of multiple teams at the Wikimedia Foundation to address this issue.

In the meantime, we ask that everyone takes a look at the passwords they have chosen for their wiki accounts. If you know that you've chosen a weak password, or if you've chosen a password that you are using somewhere else, please change those passwords.

== New way to edit wikitext ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

'''Summary''': There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|wikitext mode for the visual editor]]. Please [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|go try it out]].


We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it.

Consequently, we've planned a "wikitext mode" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the [[:mw:citoid|citoid service]] for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext.

All wikis now have access to this mode as a [[:mw:Beta Features|Beta Feature]]. When enabled, it replaces your existing [[:mw:Editor|wikitext editor]] everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an ''opt-in-only'' Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to "{{Int:Betafeatures-auto-enroll}}".

The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the [[:mw:Extension:WikiEditor|current wikitext editor]]). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and ''vice versa''), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Gadgets|work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work]] with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do.

This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor/Feedback|on the feedback page]].  You may write comments in any language.  Thank you.

== Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Updates/Initial announcements review|Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''

The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Regular updates are being sent to the [[mail:Wikimedia-l|Wikimedia-l mailing list]], and posted [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Updates|on Meta-Wiki]]. Beginning with this message, monthly reviews of these updates will be sent to this page as well.

This version of the message is available for translation and documentation purposes'' 

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

== Read-only mode for 20 to 30 minutes on 19 April and 3 May ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/Server switch 2017|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]]. 

Thank you, [[User:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[User talk:MediaWiki message delivery|talk]]) 16:52, 19 Moranang 2017 (UTC)

* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

== RevisionSlider ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:RevisionSlider|RevisionSlider]] will be available as a default feature for all users on all wikis from May 17. The RevisionSlider adds a slider view to the diff page so that you can easily move between revisions. The slider view is collapsed by default, and will load by clicking on it. It can also be turned off entirely in the user preferences. RevisionSlider has been a default feature on German, Arabic and Hebrew Wikipedia for 6 months and a beta feature on all wikis for 8 months. The feature fulfills a wish from the [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|German Community’s Technical Wishlist]]. Thanks to everyone who tested RevisionSlider and gave valuable feedback to improve the feature!

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

If you [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the Beta Feature]] for "{{Int:visualeditor-preference-visualdiffpage-label}}", you will have a new option.  It will give you a new box at the top of every diff page.  This box will let you choose either diff system on any edit.

[[File:VisualEditor visual diff tool - toggle button.png|alt=Toggle button showing visual and wikitext options; visual option is selected|center|frameless|200px]]
Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.

In the visual diff, additions, removals, new links, and formatting changes will be highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.

[[File:Visual diff paragraph move correcting vandalism 2018.png|alt=Screenshot showing the same changes to an article.  Most changes are highlighted with text formatting.|center|frameless|250px]]

This screenshot shows the same edit as the wikitext diff.  The visual diff highlights the removal of one word and the addition of a new sentence.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2017/May|the last newsletter]], the [[mw:Editing|Editing Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]], which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and improving [[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|the visual diff tool]]. Their work board is available [[phab:project/view/3236/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at [[mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[mw:Editing team/Current priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor, and improving the visual diff tool.
===Recent changes===
*The '''[[mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]]''' is [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|available as a Beta Feature]] on desktop devices.  It has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  The team have been comparing the performance of different editing environments.  They have studied how long it takes to open the page and start typing.  The study uses data for more than one million edits during December and January.  Some changes have been made to improve the speed of the 2017 wikitext editor and the visual editor.  Recently, the 2017 wikitext editor opened fastest for most edits, and the 2010 WikiEditor was fastest for some edits.  More information will be posted at [[mw:Contributors/Projects/Editing performance]].
*The '''[[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' was developed for the visual editor.  It is now available to all users of the visual editor and the 2017 wikitext editor.  When you review your changes, you can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  You can also [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the new Beta Feature]] for "Visual diffs".  The Beta Feature lets you use the visual diff tool to view other people's edits on page histories and [[Special:RecentChanges]].  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T167508]
*[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|'''Wikitext syntax highlighting''']] is available as a Beta Feature for both [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor]] and the 2010 wikitext editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
*The [[mw:Citoid|citoid service]] automatically translates URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, and PubMed id numbers into wikitext citation templates.  It is very popular and useful to editors, although it can be a bit tricky to set up.  <mark>Your wiki can have this service.  Please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|read the instructions]]. You can [[phab:T127354|ask the team to help you enable citoid at your wiki]]</mark>.

===Let's work together===
*The team will talk about editing tools at an upcoming [[m:Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meetings|Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meeting]].
*Wikibooks, Wikiversity, and other communities may have the visual editor made available by default to contributors.  If your community wants this, then please contact [[mw:User talk:Deskana (WMF)|Dan Garry]].
*The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Contributors/Projects/Columns for references|automatically display long lists of references in columns]] on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki.

== New user group for editing sitewide CSS / JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all!

To improve the security of our readers and editors, permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which contain code that is executed in the browsers of users of the site.)
A new user group, <code dir="ltr">[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code>, has been created.
Starting four weeks from now, only members of this group will be able edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with <code dir="ltr">.css</code> or <code dir="ltr">.js</code> that is either in the <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:</code> namespace or is another user's user subpage).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the change [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|here]].

Please add users who need to edit CSS/JS to the new group (this can be done the same way new administrators are added, by stewards or local bureaucrats).
This is a dangerous permission; a malicious user or a hacker taking over the account of a careless interface-admin can abuse it in far worse ways than admin permissions could be abused. Please only assign it to users who need it, who are trusted by the community, and who follow common basic password and computer security practices (use strong passwords, do not reuse passwords, use two-factor authentication if possible, do not install software of questionable origin on your machine, use antivirus software if that's a standard thing in your environment).

Thanks!

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review ==
Hello. A new policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] in 2013. According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on smaller wikis. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]].

We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#לערי ריינהארט (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki. Thanks, '''[[User:Rschen7754|Rs]][[User talk:Rschen7754|chen]][[Special:Contributions/Rschen7754|7754]]''' 05:53, 10 Phatwe 2018 (UTC)

''({{int:please-translate}})''

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hi all,

as [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS/announcement 2|announced previously]], permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed: only members of the <code>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code> ({{int:group-interface-admin}}) group, and a few highly privileged global groups such as stewards, can edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with .css or .js that is either in the MediaWiki: namespace or is another user's user subpage). This is done to improve the security of readers and editors of Wikimedia projects.

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 12 September 2018'''.
On '''Wednesday, 10 October 2018''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop when we switch.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Wednesday, 12 September and Wednesday, 10 October. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170503T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 13 September and Thursday 11 October). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

'''Change coming to how certain templates will appear on the mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
[[File:Page_issues_-_mobile_banner_example.jpg|thumb|Example of improvements]]

Hello,

In a few weeks the Readers web team will be changing how some templates look on the mobile web site. We will make these templates more noticeable when viewing the article. We ask for your help in updating any templates that don't look correct.

What kind of templates? Specifically templates that notify readers and contributors about issues with the content of an article – the text and information in the article. Examples like [[wikidata:Q5962027|Template:Unreferenced]] or [[Wikidata:Q5619503|Template:More citations needed]]. Right now these notifications are hidden behind a link under the title of an article. We will format templates like these (mostly those that use Template:Ambox or message box templates in general) to show a short summary under the page title. You can tap on the "Learn more" link to get more information.

For template editors we have [[mw:Recommendations_for_mobile_friendly_articles_on_Wikimedia_wikis#Making_page_issues_(ambox_templates)_mobile_friendly|some recommendations on how to make templates that are mobile-friendly]] and also further [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|documentation on our work so far]].

If you have questions about formatting templates for mobile, [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|please leave a note on the project talk page]] or [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Readers-Web-Backlog file a task in Phabricator] and we will help you.

== FileExporter beta feature ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 
[[File:Logo for the beta feature FileExporter.svg|thumb|Coming soon: the beta feature [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]]]
A new beta feature will soon be released on all wikis: The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter]]. It allows exports of files from a local wiki to Wikimedia Commons, including their file history and page history. Which files can be exported is defined by each wiki's community: '''Please check your wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration file documentation|configuration file]]''' if you want to use this feature.

The FileExporter has already been a beta feature on [https://www.mediawiki.org mediawiki.org], [https://meta.wikimedia.org meta.wikimedia], deWP, faWP, arWP, koWP and on [https://wikisource.org wikisource.org]. After some functionality was added, it's now becoming a beta feature on all wikis. Deployment is planned for January 16. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|on the project page]]. 

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test the FileExporter, please activate it in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]]. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help_talk:Extension:FileImporter|central talk page]]. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning a [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|global consultation about communication]]. The goal is to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to improve tools for communication.

We want all contributors to be able to talk to each other on the wikis, whatever their experience, their skills or their devices.

We are looking for input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible. It will come from multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives.

We are currently planning the consultation. We need your help.

'''We need volunteers to help talk to their communities or user groups.'''

You can help by hosting a discussion at your wiki. Here's what to do:  
# First, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Participant group sign-up|sign up your group here.]]  
# Next, create a page (or a section on a Village pump, or an e-mail thread – whatever is natural for your group) to collect information from other people in your group.  This is not a vote or decision-making discussion: we are just collecting feedback.  
# Then ask people what they think about communication processes.  We want to hear stories and other information about how people communicate with each other on and off wiki.  Please consider asking these five questions:
## When you want to discuss a topic with your community, what tools work for you, and what problems block you?
## What about talk pages works for newcomers, and what blocks them?
## What do others struggle with in your community about talk pages?
## What do you wish you could do on talk pages, but can't due to the technical limitations?
## What are the important aspects of a "wiki discussion"?
# Finally, please go to [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk pages consultation 2019 on Mediawiki.org]] and report what you learned from your group.  Please include links if the discussion is available to the public.

'''You can also help build the list of the many different ways people talk to each other.'''

Not all groups active on wikis or around wikis use the same way to discuss things: it can happen on wiki, on social networks, through external tools... Tell us [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use|how your group communicates]].

You can read more about [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the overall process]] on mediawiki.org. If you have questions or ideas, you can [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|leave feedback about the consultation process]] in the language you prefer.

Thank you! We're looking forward to talking with you.

</div></div>

Welcome back to the [[mw:Editing|Editing]] newsletter.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2018/October|the last newsletter]], the team has released two new features for the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|mobile visual editor]] and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to [[m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2018-2019/Audiences#Outcome 3: Mobile Contribution|make editing on mobile web simpler]].  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

<strong>Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?</strong>

If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

<em>Follow these instructions and share your experience:</em>

<strong>[[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 Try Edit Cards]].</strong>

=== Recent releases ===
The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the [[mw:Reading/Web/Mobile#About|mobile site]].  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 

# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing|Section editing]]
#* The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.
#* The team studied this with an A/B test.  [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing#16 June 2019|This test showed]] that contributors who could use section editing were '''1% more likely to publish''' the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.
# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#March 1, 2019|Loading overlay]]
#* The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.

Section editing and the new loading overlay are '''now available to everyone''' using the mobile visual editor.

=== New and active projects ===
This is a list of our most active projects. [[mw:Help:Watching pages|Watch]] these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.

*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|Edit cards]]: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  <em>Go here to see how:</em> [[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 <em>Try Edit Cards</em>]].
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Mobile toolbar refresh]]: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|Mobile visual editor availability]]: This A/B test asks:  ''Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?''  We are collaborating with [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default#26 June 2019 %E2%80%93 Participating wikis and test start date|20 Wikipedias]] to answer this question.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Usability improvements|Usability improvements]]: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.

=== Looking ahead ===

* '''Wikimania:'''  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending [[wmania:|Wikimania]] in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|Community Growth space]].  Talk to the team about how editing can be improved.
* '''Talk Pages:'''  In the coming months, the Editing Team will begin [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|improving talk pages]] and communication on the wikis.

=== Learning more ===
The [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|VisualEditor on mobile]] is a good place to learn more about the projects we are working on. The team wants to talk with you about anything related to editing. If you have something to say or ask, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

== Update on the consultation about office actions ==

Hello all, 

Last month, the Wikimedia Foundation's Trust & Safety team [[:en:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_152#Announcement_of_forthcoming_temporary_and_partial_ban_tool_consultation|announced]] a future consultation about partial and/or temporary [[m:Special:MyLanguage/office actions|office actions]]. We want to let you know that the '''draft version''' of this consultation has now been [[:m:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|posted on Meta]]. 

This is a '''draft'''. It is not intended to be the consultation itself, which will be posted on Meta likely in early September. Please do not treat this draft as a consultation. Instead, we ask your assistance in forming the final language for the consultation.

For that end, we would like your input over the next couple of weeks about what questions the consultation should ask about partial and temporary Foundation office action bans and how it should be formatted. '''[[:m:Talk:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|Please post it on the draft talk page]]'''. Our goal is to provide space for the community to discuss all the aspects of these office actions that need to be discussed, and we want to ensure with your feedback that the consultation is presented in the best way to encourage frank and constructive conversation.

Please visit [[:m:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|the consultation draft on Meta-wiki]] and leave your comments on the draft’s talk page about what the consultation should look like and what questions it should ask. 

Thank you for your input! -- The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety|Trust & Safety team]] 08:03, 16 Phatwe 2019 (UTC)

== New tools and IP masking ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hey everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling.

We have an idea of what tools ''could'' be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project [[m:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|on Meta]] and [[m:Talk:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|post comments and feedback]]. Now is when we need to hear from you to be able to give you better tools to handle vandalism, spam and harassment.

You can post in your language if you can't write in English.

== The consultation on partial and temporary Foundation bans just started ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<div class="plainlinks">
Hello, 

In a [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|recent statement]], the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|requested that staff hold a consultation]] to "re-evaluat[e] or add community input to the two new office action policy tools (temporary and partial Foundation bans)".

Accordingly, the Foundation's Trust & Safety team invites all Wikimedians [[:m:Office actions/Community consultation on partial and temporary office actions/09 2019|to join this consultation and give their feedback]] from 30 September to 30 October. 

How can you help?

* Suggest how partial and temporary Foundation bans should be used, if they should (eg: On all projects, or only on a subset);

* Give ideas about how partial and temporary Foundation bans should ideally implemented, if they should be; and/or

* Propose changes to the existing Office Actions policy on partial and temporary bans.

We offer our thanks in advance for your contributions, and we hope to get as much input as possible from community members during this consultation!

== Feedback wanted on Desktop Improvements project ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{Int:Please-translate}}

{{int:Hello}}. The Readers Web team at the WMF will work on some [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|improvements to the desktop interface]] over the next couple of years. The goal is to increase usability without removing any functionality. We have been inspired by changes made by volunteers, but that currently only exist as local gadgets and user scripts, prototypes, and volunteer-led skins. We would like to begin the process of bringing some of these changes into the default experience on all Wikimedia projects. 

We are currently in the research stage of this project and are looking for ideas for improvements, as well as feedback on our current ideas and mockups.  So far, we have performed interviews with community members at Wikimania. We have gathered lists of previous volunteer and WMF work in this area. We are examining possible technical approaches for such changes.  

We would like individual feedback on the following:

* Identifying focus areas for the project we have not yet discovered
* Expanding the list of existing gadgets and user scripts that are related to providing a better desktop experience. If you can think of some of these from your wiki, please let us know
* Feedback on the ideas and mockups we have collected so far

We would also like to gather a list of wikis that would be interested in being test wikis for this project - these wikis would be the first to receive the updates once we’re ready to start building. 

When giving feedback, please consider the following goals of the project:

* Make it easier for readers to focus on the content
* Provide easier access to everyday actions (e.g. search, language switching, editing)
* Put things in logical and useful places
* Increase consistency in the interface with other platforms - mobile web and the apps
* Eliminate clutter
* Plan for future growth

As well as the following constraints:

* Not touching the content - no work will be done in terms of styling templates or to the structure of page contents themselves
* Not removing any functionality - things might move around, but all navigational items and other functionality currently available by default will remain
* No drastic changes to the layout - we're taking an evolutionary approach to the changes and want the site to continue feeling familiar to readers and editors

Please give all feedback (in any language) at [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements]] 

After this round of feedback, we plan on building a prototype of suggested changes based on the feedback we receive. You’ll hear from us again asking for feedback on this prototype.

== Beta feature "Reference Previews" ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 
A new beta feature will soon be deployed to your wiki: [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|Reference Previews]]. As you might guess from the name, this feature gives you a preview of references in the article text. That means, you can look up a reference without jumping down to the bottom of the page.

Reference Previews have already been a beta feature on German and Arabic Wikipedia since April. Now they will become available on more wikis. Deployment is planned for October 24. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|on the project page]].

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test Reference Previews, please activate the beta feature in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]] and let us know what you think. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help talk:Reference Previews|central talk page]]. We hope the feature will serve you well in your work.

Inside this newsletter, the [[mw:Editing|Editing team]] talks about their work on the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]], on [[mw:Talk pages project|the new talk pages project]], and at [[wikimania:|Wikimania 2019]].

=== Help ===
<strong>What talk page interactions do you remember?</strong> Is it a story about how someone helped you to learn something new? Is it a story about how someone helped you get involved in a group? Something else?  Whatever your story is, we want to hear it!  

Please tell us a story about how you used a talk page.  <mark>Please share a link to a memorable discussion, or describe it on the <strong>[[mw:Topic:V8d91yh8gcg404dj|talk page for this project]]</strong>.</mark>  The team wants your examples.  These examples will help everyone develop a shared understanding of what this project should support and encourage.

=== Talk pages project ===
The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk Pages Consultation]] was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 2 report|Phase 2 Report]] of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: [[mw:Talk pages project|Talk Page Project project page]]. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>"Getting involved"</strong>]] section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

=== Mobile visual editor ===
The Editing team is trying to make it simpler to edit on mobile devices.  The team is changing the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|visual editor on mobile]]. If you have something to say about editing on a mobile device, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

**<em>New navigation:</em> The buttons for moving forward and backward in the edit flow have changed.
**<em>Seamless switching:</em> an [[phab:T228159|improved workflow]] for switching between the visual and wikitext modes.
* Feedback: You can try the refreshed toolbar by opening the mobile VisualEditor on a smartphone. Please post your feedback on the [[mw:Topic:V79x6zm8n6i4nb56|Toolbar feedback talk page]].

=== Wikimania ===
The Editing Team attended [[wmania:2019:Program|Wikimania 2019]] in Sweden.  They led a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|the mobile visual editor]] and a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/After Flow: A new direction for improving talk pages|the new talk pages project]].  They tested [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh#v1 prototype|two]] new [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards#v3 prototype|features]] in the mobile visual editor with contributors.  You can read more about what the team did and learned in [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#Wikimania Stockholm: Overview|the team's report on Wikimania 2019]].

=== Looking ahead ===

== Movement Learning and Leadership Development Project ==

Hello

The Wikimedia Foundation’s Community Development team is seeking to learn more about the way volunteers learn and develop into the many different roles that exist in the movement. Our goal is to build a movement informed framework that provides shared clarity and outlines accessible pathways on how to grow and develop skills within the movement. To this end, we are looking to speak with you, our community to learn about your journey as a Wikimedia volunteer. Whether you joined yesterday or have been here from the very start, we want to hear about the many ways volunteers join and contribute to our movement.

To learn more about the project, [[:m:special:MyLanguage/Movement Learning and Leadership Development Project|please visit the Meta page]].

== Additional interface for edit conflicts on talk pages ==

''Sorry, for writing this text in English. If you could help to translate it, it would be appreciated.'' 

You might know the new interface for edit conflicts (currently a beta feature). Now, Wikimedia Germany is designing an additional interface to solve edit conflicts on talk pages. This interface is shown to you when you write on a discussion page and another person writes a discussion post in the same line and saves it before you do. With this additional editing conflict interface you can adjust the order of the comments and edit your comment.  We are inviting everyone to have a look at [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Edit Conflicts#Edit conflicts on talk pages|the planned feature]]. Let us know what you think on our [[mw:Help talk:Two Column Edit Conflict View|central feedback page]]! -- For the Technical Wishes Team: [[m:User:Max Klemm (WMDE)|Max Klemm (WMDE)]] 14:15, 26 Tlhakole 2020 (UTC)

[[File:WPWP logo 1.png|150px|right|Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP)]]
This is to invite you to join the Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP) campaign to help improve Wikipedia articles with photos and win prizes. The campaign starts today 1st July 2020 and closes 31st August 2020.

The campaign primarily aims at using images from Wikimedia Commons on Wikipedia articles that are lacking images. Participants will choose among Wikipedia pages without photo images, then add a suitable file from among the many thousands of photos in the Wikimedia Commons, especially those uploaded from thematic contests (Wiki Loves Africa, Wiki Loves Earth, Wiki Loves Folklore, etc.) over the years.

Please visit the '''[[m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos|campaign page]]''' to learn more about the WPWP Campaign.

With kind regards,

Thank you,

Seven years ago this month, the [[mw:Editing team|Editing team]] offered the visual editor to most Wikipedia editors.  Since then, editors have achieved many milestones:

* More than <strong>50 million edits</strong> have been made using the visual editor on desktop.
* More than <strong>2 million new articles</strong> have been created in the visual editor. More than 600,000 of these new articles were created during 2019.
* The visual editor is <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.  The proportion of all edits made using the visual editor has increased every year since its introduction.
* In 2019, <strong>35% of the edits by newcomers</strong> (logged-in editors with ≤99 edits) used the visual editor. This percentage has <strong>increased every year</strong>.
* Almost <strong>5 million edits on the mobile site</strong> have been made with the visual editor.  Most of these edits have been made since the Editing team started improving the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]] in 2018.
* On 17 November 2019, the [https://discuss-space.wmflabs.org/t/first-edit-made-to-wikipedia-from-outer-space/2254 <strong>first edit from outer space</strong>] was made in the mobile visual editor. 🚀 👩‍🚀
* Editors have made more than <strong>7 million edits in the 2017 wikitext editor</strong>, including starting <strong>600,000 new articles</strong> in it.

== Announcing a new wiki project! Welcome, Abstract Wikipedia ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all,

It is my honor to introduce Abstract Wikipedia, a new project that has been unanimously approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. Abstract Wikipedia proposes a new way to generate baseline encyclopedic content in a multilingual fashion, allowing more contributors and more readers to share more knowledge in more languages. It is an approach that aims to make cross-lingual cooperation easier on our projects, increase the sustainability of our movement through expanding access to participation, improve the user experience for readers of all languages, and innovate in free knowledge by connecting some of the strengths of our movement to create something new.

This is our first new project in over seven years. Abstract Wikipedia was submitted as a project proposal by Denny Vrandečić in May 2020 <ref>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract Wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia]]</ref> after years of preparation and research, leading to a detailed plan and lively discussions in the Wikimedia communities. We know that the energy and the creativity of the community often runs up against language barriers, and information that is available in one language may not make it to other language Wikipedias. Abstract Wikipedia intends to look and feel like a Wikipedia, but build on the powerful, language-independent conceptual models of Wikidata, with the goal of letting volunteers create and maintain Wikipedia articles across our polyglot Wikimedia world.

The project will allow volunteers to assemble the fundamentals of an article using words and entities from Wikidata. Because Wikidata uses conceptual models that are meant to be universal across languages, it should be possible to use and extend these building blocks of knowledge to create models for articles that also have universal value. Using code, volunteers will be able to translate these abstract “articles” into their own languages. If successful, this could eventually allow everyone to read about any topic in Wikidata in their own language.

As you can imagine, this work will require a lot of software development, and a lot of cooperation among Wikimedians. In order to make this effort possible, Denny will join the Foundation as a staff member in July and lead this initiative. You may know Denny as the creator of Wikidata, a long-time community member, a former staff member at Wikimedia Deutschland, and a former Trustee at the Wikimedia Foundation <ref>[[m:User:Denny|User:Denny]]</ref>. We are very excited that Denny will bring his skills and expertise to work on this project alongside the Foundation’s product, technology, and community liaison teams.

It is important to acknowledge that this is an experimental project, and that every Wikipedia community has different needs. This project may offer some communities great advantages. Other communities may engage less. Every language Wikipedia community will be free to choose and moderate whether or how they would use content from this project.

We are excited that this new wiki-project has the possibility to advance knowledge equity through increased access to knowledge. It also invites us to consider and engage with critical questions about how and by whom knowledge is constructed. We look forward to working in cooperation with the communities to think through these important questions.

There is much to do as we begin designing a plan for Abstract Wikipedia in close collaboration with our communities. I encourage you to get involved by going to the project page and joining the new mailing list <ref>[[mail:abstract-wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia mailing list]]</ref>. We recognize that Abstract Wikipedia is ambitious, but we also recognize its potential. We invite you all to join us on a new, unexplored path.

Yours,

Katherine Maher (Executive Director, Wikimedia Foundation)

== The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC): we want to hear from you. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''{{int:Hello}}. Apologies that you may not be reading this message in your native language: translations of the following message may be available on [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Message to small and medium sized wikis|Meta]]. {{int:please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}''<br>

At times, our contributor communities and projects have suffered from a lack of guidelines that can help us create an environment where free knowledge can be shared safely without fear. 
There has been talk about the need for a global set of conduct rules in different communities over time. 

Recently, the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees announced a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard/May_2020_-_Board_of_Trustees_on_Healthy_Community_Culture,_Inclusivity,_and_Safe_Spaces|Community Culture Statement]], asking for new standards to address harassment and promote inclusivity across projects.

The universal code of conduct will be a binding minimum set of standards across all Wikimedia projects, and will apply to all of us, staff and volunteers alike, all around the globe. It is of great importance that we all participate in expressing our opinions and thoughts about UCoC and its values. We should think about what we want it to cover or include and what it shouldn’t include, and how it may create difficulties or help our groups. 

This is the time to talk about it. Before starting drafting the code of conduct, we would like to hear from you and to solicit the opinions and feedback of your colleagues. 
In order for your voice to be heard, we encourage and invite you to read more about [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct|the universal code of conduct (UCoC)]] and then write down your opinions or feedback [[:m:Talk:Universal_Code_of_Conduct|on the discussion page]].  

To reduce language barriers during the process, you are welcome to translate [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Universal+Code+of+Conduct&language=en&action=page&filter= the universal code of conduct main page] from English into your respective local language. You and your community may choose to provide your opinions/feedback using your local languages. 

Thanks in advance for your attention and contributions, [[:m:Talk:Trust_and_Safety|The Trust and Safety team at Wikimedia Foundation]] 16:42, 22 Phukwi 2020 (UTC)

== Technical Wishes: FileExporter and FileImporter become default features on all Wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter and FileImporter]] will become a default features on all wikis until August 7, 2020. They are planned to help you to move files from your local wiki to Wikimedia Commons easier while keeping all original file information (Description, Source, Date, Author, View History) intact. Additionally, the move is documented in the files view history. 
How does it work? 

Step 1: If you are an auto-confirmed user, you will see a link "Move file to Wikimedia Commons" on the local file page. 

Step 2: When you click on this link, the FileImporter checks if the file can in fact be moved to Wikimedia Commons. These checks are performed based on the wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration_file_documentation|configuration file]] which is created and maintained by each local wiki community. 

Step 3: If the file is compatible with Wikimedia Commons, you will be taken to an import page, at which you can update or add information regarding the file, such as the description. You can also add the 'Now Commons' template to the file on the local wiki by clicking the corresponding check box in the import form. Admins can delete the file from the local wiki by enabling the corresponding checkbox. By clicking on the 'Import' button at the end of the page, the file is imported to Wikimedia Commons. 

If you want to know more about the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileImporter extension]] or the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes|Technical Wishes Project]], follow the links. --For the Technical Wishes Team: </div>[[User:Max Klemm (WMDE)|Max Klemm (WMDE)]] 09:14, 6 Phatwe 2020 (UTC)

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data centre on '''Tuesday, September 1st 2020'''.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, September 1st. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200901T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 19:30 IST, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Wednesday September 2).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of September 1st, 2020.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.  '''Please share this information with your community.'''

== Wiki of functions naming contest ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{int:Please-translate}}

{{int:Hello}}. Please help pick a name for the new Wikimedia wiki project. This project will be a wiki where the community can work together on a library of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract_Wikipedia/Wiki_of_functions_naming_contest#function|functions]]. The community can create new functions, read about them, discuss them, and share them. Some of these functions will be used to help create language-independent Wikipedia articles that can be displayed in any language, as part of the Abstract Wikipedia project. But functions will also be usable in many other situations.

There will be two rounds of voting, each followed by legal review of candidates, with voting beginning on 29 September and 27 October. Our goal is to have a final project name selected on 8 December. If you would like to participate, then '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract Wikipedia/Wiki of functions naming contest|please learn more and vote now]]''' at meta-wiki. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}} --[[m:User:Quiddity (WMF)|Quiddity (WMF)]]</div> 21:22, 29 Lwetse 2020 (UTC)

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] tests the switch between its first and secondary data centers.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic back to the primary data center on '''Tuesday, October 27 2020'''.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, October 27. The test will start at [https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1603807200 14:00 UTC] (14:00 WET, 15:00 CET, 10:00 EDT, 19:30 IST, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 03:00 NZDT on Wednesday October 28).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of October 26, 2020.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch_Datacenter#Schedule_for_2020_switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this. A banner will be displayed on all wikis 30 minutes before this operation happens.

== Wikidata descriptions changes to be included more often in Recent Changes and Watchlist ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for sending this message in English. Translations are available on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Announcements/Announcement Wikidata descriptions in watchlist|this page]]. Feel free to translate it in more languages!''

As you may know, you can include changes coming from Wikidata in your Watchlist and Recent Changes ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist|in your preferences]]). Until now, this feature didn’t always include changes made on Wikidata descriptions due to the way Wikidata tracks the data used in a given article.

Starting on December 3rd, the Watchlist and Recent Changes will include changes on the descriptions of Wikidata Items that are used in the pages that you watch. This will only include descriptions in the language of your wiki to make sure that you’re only seeing changes that are relevant to your wiki.

This improvement was requested by many users from different projects. We hope that it can help you monitor the changes on Wikidata descriptions that affect your wiki and participate in the effort of improving the data quality on Wikidata for all Wikimedia wikis and beyond.

Note: if you didn’t use the Wikidata watchlist integration feature for a long time, feel free to give it another chance! The feature has been improved since the beginning and the content it displays is more precise and useful than at the beginning of the feature in 2015.

If you encounter any issue or want to provide feedback, feel free to use [[Phab:T191831|this Phabricator ticket]]. Thanks!

== Universal Code of Conduct – 2021 consultations ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== Universal Code of Conduct Phase 2 ===

{{int:please-translate}}

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

[[File:Technical_Wishes_–_Line_numbering_-_2010_wikitext_editor.png|thumb|Example]]
From April 15, you can enable line numbering in some wikitext editors - for now in the template namespace, coming to more namespaces soon. This will make it easier to detect line breaks and to refer to a particular line in discussions. These numbers will be shown if you enable the syntax highlighting feature ([[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|CodeMirror extension]]), which is supported in the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:WikiEditor|2010]] and [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/2017 wikitext editor|2017]] wikitext editors.

== Suggested Values ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

From April 29, it will be possible to suggest values for parameters in templates.

This allows template users to quickly select an appropriate value. This way, it prevents potential errors and reduces the effort needed to fill the template with values. It will still be possible to fill in values other than the suggested ones.

== Wikimania 2021: Individual Program Submissions ==

[[File:Wikimania logo with text 2.svg|right|200px]]
Dear all,

Wikimania 2021 will be [[:wikimania:2021:Save the date and the Core Organizing Team|hosted virtually]] for the first time in the event's 15-year history. Since there is no in-person host, the event is being organized by a diverse group of Wikimedia volunteers that form the [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers|Core Organizing Team]] (COT) for Wikimania 2021.

'''Event Program''' - Individuals or a group of individuals can submit their session proposals to be a part of the program. There will be translation support for sessions provided in a number of languages. See more information [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines#Language Accessibility|here]].

Below are some links to guide you through;
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions|Program Submissions]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines|Session Submission Guidelines]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:FAQ|FAQ]]

Please note that the deadline for submission is 18th June 2021. 

'''Announcements'''- To keep up to date with the developments around Wikimania, the COT sends out weekly updates. You can view them in the Announcement section [[:wikimania:2021:Announcements|here]]. 

'''Office Hour''' - If you are left with questions, the COT will be hosting some office hours (in multiple languages), in multiple time-zones, to answer any programming questions that you might have.  Details can be found [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers#Office hours schedule|here.]]

[[File:Reply Tool A-B test comment completion.png|alt=Junior contributors comment completion rate across all participating Wikipedias|thumb|296x296px|When newcomers had the Reply tool and tried to post on a talk page, they were more successful at posting a comment. ([https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ Source])]]

Earlier this year, the Editing team ran a large study of [[mw:Talk pages project/Replying|the Reply Tool]].  The main goal was to find out whether the Reply Tool helped [[mw:Talk pages project/Glossary|newer editors]] communicate on wiki.  The second goal was to see whether the comments that newer editors made using the tool needed to be reverted more frequently than comments newer editors made with the existing wikitext page editor.

The key results were:

* Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ more likely] to post a comment on a talk page.
* The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ less likely] to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.

These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

<strong>Looking ahead</strong>

The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to [[phab:T280599|resolve a technical challenge]]. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the [[phab:T267379|Wikipedias that participated in the study]].  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "{{int:discussiontools-preference-label}}" [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|in Beta Features]] now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion]].

== Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election has come to an end ==

Thank you for participating in the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021|2021 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election]]! Voting closed August 31 at 23:59. The official data, including the four most voted candidates, will be announced as soon as the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections_committee|Elections Committee]] completes their review of the ballots. The official announcement of the new trustees appointed will happen later, once the selected candidates have been confirmed by the Board.

6,946 community members from 216 wiki projects have voted. This makes 10.2% global participation, 1.1% higher than in the last Board elections. In 2017, 5167 people from 202 wiki projects cast their vote. A full analysis is planned to be published in a few days when the confirmed results are announced. In the meantime, you can check the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021/Stats|data produced during the election]].

Diversity was an important goal with these elections. Messages about the Board election were translated into 61 languages. This outreach worked well. There were 70 communities with eligible voters voting in this election for the first time. With your help, next year’s Board of Trustees election will be even better.

== The 2022 Community Wishlist Survey will happen in January ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello everyone,

We hope all of you are as well and safe as possible during these trying times! We wanted to share some news about a change to the Community Wishlist Survey 2022. We would like to hear your opinions as well.

Summary:

<div style="font-style:italic;">
We will be running the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]] 2022 in January 2022. We need more time to work on the 2021 wishes. We also need time to prepare some changes to the Wishlist 2022. In the meantime, you can use a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|dedicated sandbox to leave early ideas for the 2022 wishes]].
</div>

=== Proposing and wish-fulfillment will happen during the same year ===

In the past, the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Tech|Community Tech]] team has run the Community Wishlist Survey for the following year in November of the prior year. For example, we ran the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey 2021|Wishlist for 2021]] in November 2020. That worked well a few years ago. At that time, we used to start working on the Wishlist soon after the results of the voting were published.

However, in 2021, there was a delay between the voting and the time when we could start working on the new wishes. Until July 2021, we were working on wishes from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey 2020|Wishlist for 2020]].

We hope having the Wishlist 2022 in January 2022 will be more intuitive. This will also give us time to fulfill more wishes from the 2021 Wishlist.

=== Encouraging wider participation from historically excluded communities ===

We are thinking how to make the Wishlist easier to participate in. We want to support more translations, and encourage under-resourced communities to be more active. We would like to have some time to make these changes.

=== A new space to talk to us about priorities and wishes not granted yet ===

We will have gone 365 days without a Wishlist. We encourage you to approach us. We hope to hear from you in the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Talk:Community Wishlist Survey|talk page]], but we also hope to see you at our bi-monthly Talk to Us meetings! These will be hosted at two different times friendly to time zones around the globe.

We will begin our first meeting '''September 15th at 23:00 UTC'''. More details about the agenda and format coming soon!

=== Brainstorm and draft proposals before the proposal phase ===

If you have early ideas for wishes, you can use the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|new Community Wishlist Survey sandbox]]. This way, you will not forget about these before January 2022. You will be able to come back and refine your ideas. Remember, edits in the sandbox don't count as wishes!

=== Feedback ===
* What should we do to improve the Wishlist pages?
* How would you like to use our new [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey/Sandbox|sandbox?]]
* What, if any, risks do you foresee in our decision to change the date of the Wishlist 2022?
* What will help more people participate in the Wishlist 2022?

Answer on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Talk:Community Wishlist Survey|talk page]] (in any language you prefer) or at our Talk to Us meetings.

We are looking for people who have some of the following [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement_Charter/Drafting_Committee#Role_Requirements|skills]]:

* Know how to write collaboratively. (demonstrated experience is a plus) 
* Are ready to find compromises. 
* Focus on inclusion and diversity. 
* Have knowledge of community consultations. 
* Have intercultural communication experience. 
* Have governance or organization experience in non-profits or communities. 
* Have experience negotiating with different parties. 

The Committee is expected to start with 15 people. If there are 20 or more candidates, a mixed election and selection process will happen. If there are 19 or fewer candidates, then the process of selection without election takes place.

Will you help move Wikimedia forward in this important role? Submit your candidacy [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement_Charter/Drafting_Committee#Candidate_Statements|here]].

The Board of Trustees is preparing a call for feedback about the upcoming Board Elections, from January 7 - February 10, 2022.

While details will be finalized the week before the call, we have confirmed at least two questions that will be asked during this call for feedback:

* What is the best way to ensure fair representation of emerging communities among the Board?

* What involvement should candidates have during the election?

While additional questions may be added, the Movement Strategy and Governance team wants to provide time for community members and affiliates to consider and prepare ideas on the confirmed questions before the call opens. We apologize for not having a complete list of questions at this time. The list of questions should only grow by one or two questions. The intention is to not overwhelm the community with requests, but provide notice and welcome feedback on these important questions.

'''Do you want to help organize local conversation during this Call?'''

Contact the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Strategy and Governance|Movement Strategy and Governance team]] on Meta, on [https://t.me/wmboardgovernancechat Telegram], or via email at msg[[File:At sign.svg|16x16px|link=|(_AT_)]]wikimedia.org.

Reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The Movement Strategy and Governance team will be minimally staffed until January 3. Please excuse any delayed response during this time. We also recognize some community members and affiliates are offline during the December holidays. We apologize if our message has reached you while you are on holiday.

Best,

The Call for Feedback: Board of Trustees elections is now open and will close on 7 February 2022. 

With this Call for Feedback, the Movement Strategy and Governance team is taking a different approach. This approach incorporates community feedback from 2021. Instead of leading with proposals, the Call is framed around key questions from the Board of Trustees. The key questions came from the feedback about the 2021 Board of Trustees election. The intention is to inspire collective conversation and collaborative proposal development about these key questions.

Hello everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees released a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board noticeboard/January 2022 - Board of Trustees on Community ratification of enforcement guidelines of UCoC|statement on the ratification process]] for the '''[[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines|Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) Enforcement Guidelines]]'''.

The [[m:Universal Code of Conduct|Universal Code of Conduct]] (UCoC) provides a baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire movement. The UCoC and the Enforcement Guidelines were written by [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|volunteer-staff drafting committees]] following community consultations.

The revised guidelines were published 24 January 2022 as a proposed way to apply the policy across the movement. There is a [[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines/Changes|list of changes made]] to the guidelines after the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement draft guidelines review|enforcement draft guidelines review]]. '''Comments about the guidelines can be shared [[m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines|on the Enforcement Guidelines talk page on Meta-wiki]].'''

To help to understand the guidelines and process, the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Strategy and Governance|Movement Strategy and Governance]] (MSG) team will be hosting Conversation Hours on 4 February 2022 at 15:00 UTC, 25 February 2022 at 12:00 UTC, and 4 March 2022 at 15:00 UTC. '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Conversations|Join the conversation hours to speak with the UCoC project team and drafting committee members about the updated guidelines and voting process]].'''

The [[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Project#Timeline|timeline is available on Meta-wiki]]. The voting period is March 7 to 21. All eligible voters will have an opportunity to support or oppose the adoption of the Enforcement guidelines, and share why. '''[[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines/Voting|See the voting information page for more details]].'''

Many participants from across the movement have provided valuable input in these ongoing conversations. The UCoC and MSG teams want to thank the Drafting Committee and the community members for their contributions to this process. 

Sincerely,

Movement Strategy and Governance<br/>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<section begin="announcement-content" />Hello! 

The Movement Strategy and Governance team of the Wikimedia Foundation would like to invite you to the next event about "Regional and Thematic Hubs". The Wikimedia Movement is in the process of understanding what Regional and Thematic Hubs should be. Our workshop in November was a good start ([[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Documentation/27 November Workshop|read the report]]), but we're not finished yet. 

Over the last weeks we conducted about 16 interviews with groups working on establishing a Hub in their context ([[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Dialogue|see Hubs Dialogue]]). These interviews informed a report that will serve as a foundation for discussion on March 12. The report is planned to be published on March 9.

The event will take place on March 12, 13:00 to 16:00 UTC on Zoom. Interpretation will be provided in French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. Registration is open, and will close on March 10. Anyone interested in the topic is invited to join us. '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Global Conversations March 12, 2022|More information on the event on Meta-wiki]]'''.

Best regards,

== Deployment of FLORES Machine Translation to Tswana Wikipedia ==

Hello Friends!

Apologies as this message is not in your native language {{Int:Please-translate}}. 

The WMF Language team plans to introduce a machine translation (MT) support for the Content Translation in Tswana Wikipedia called FLORES. This means that you can choose to use [https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-flores-101-data-set-helping-build-better-translation-systems-around-the-world/ FLORES machine translation] when translating Wikipedia articles to Tswana using [https://tn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ContentTranslation the Content Translation tool].
 
The FLORES Machine Translation is provided by an [https://ai.facebook.com/ AI research team at Meta] through a free for use API key that allows the Content Translation to access the service on the FLORES server for an evaluation trial period. This MT will be set as default in your Wikipedia, but you can choose not to use it by selecting  "Start with empty paragraph" from the "Initial Translation" dropdown menu.
 
The Wikimedia Foundation has worked out an agreement that allows the use of FLORES without compromising Wikipedia’s policies about attribution of rights, your privacy as a user, and brand representation. You can find more information about the FLORES Machine translation on [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation/Machine_Translation/Flores#Summary_of_our_agreement_with_Meta this page].
 
Please note that the use of the FLORES MT is not compulsory. However, we would want your community to:
*use it once it is deployed to improve the quality of the Machine Translation service
*[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk:Content_translation provide feedback] about our plans, its quality once deployed and ask any questions you might have about this addition.
 
We trust that introducing this MT is a good support to the Content Translations tool towards having better quality articles in Tswana Wikipedia.
 
Thank you!

===FLORES Machine Translation deployed Tswana Wikipedia===
Hello Friends!

The WMF Language team is pleased to inform you that we have deployed the FLORES machine translation (MT) support for the Content Translation in Tswana Wikipedia.  
Please remember that the FLORES machine translation is set as default in your Wikipedia. Still, you can choose not to use it by selecting "Start with empty paragraph" from the "Initial Translation" dropdown menu. However, we would want your community to:

*use it to improve the quality of the Machine Translation service
*provide feedback about its quality and ask any questions you might have about this addition.

We look forward to your community using the Machine Translation support in Content Translation to create better quality articles in Tswana Wikipedia.

Thank you!

Hello all,

We'd like to provide an update on the work on the Enforcement Guidelines for the Universal Code of Conduct.  After the conclusion of the community vote on the guidelines in March, the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Community Affairs Committee|Community Affairs committee (CAC)]] of the Board [https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/JAYQN3NYKCHQHONMUONYTI6WRKZFQNSC/ asked that several areas of the guidelines be reviewed for improvements] before the Board does its final review. These areas were identified based on community discussions and comments provided during the vote. The CAC also requested review of the controversial Note in 3.1 of the UCoC itself.

Once more, a big thank you to all who voted, especially to all who left constructive feedback and comments!  The project team is working with the Board to establish a timeline for this work, and will communicate this next month. 

Members of the two prior [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|UCoC Drafting Committees]] have generously offered their time to help shape improvements to the Guidelines. You can read more about them and their work [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee#Revisions_Committee|here]], as well as read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct/Drafting_committee/Phase_2_meeting_summaries#2022|summaries of their weekly meetings in 2022]]. 

Wikimedians have provided many valuable comments together with the vote and in other conversations. Given the size and diversity of the Wikimedia community, there are even more voices out there who can give ideas on how to improve the enforcement guidelines and add even more valuable ideas to the process. To help the Revisions committee identify improvements, input on several questions for the committee’s review is requested. Visit the Meta-wiki pages ([[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct/Enforcement_guidelines/Revision_discussions|Enforcement Guidelines revision discussions]], [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct/Policy text/Revision_discussions|Policy text revision discussions]]) to get your ideas to the Committee - it is very important that viewpoints are heard from different communities before the Committee begins drafting revision proposals.

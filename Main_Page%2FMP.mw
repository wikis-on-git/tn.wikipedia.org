Welcome to [[Wikipedia]], a community project with the goal to create in every language from a neutral point of view a free encyclopedia on the internet. Wikipedia is free of charge, and can be used to find information even without logging in, but also to add information or to edit. Because of this, Wikipedia can give [[Wikipedia:Disclaimer|no guarantee]] for the correctness of the available information. You can experiment in the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]. This Tswana Wikipedia counts [[Special:statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles.
